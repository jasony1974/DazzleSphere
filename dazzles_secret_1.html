        <p>It was a rainy afternoon, a little while after lunch, and Emerald was curled up on her bed, watching a video on her 
            iPad of one of her favorite ballerinas dance, when she said to herself quietly: &quot;This makes me think of Mom.&quot; 
            She sighed. &quot;Oh, I do wish I would&apos;ve gotten to see her dance!&quot;</p>  
        <p>Then, as she sat there, an idea popped into Emerald&apos;s head. &quot;I know! Maybe I will read Mom&apos;s diaries to 
            soothe me on this rainy day!&quot; she exclaimed. And she set off to do so.</p> <br>
                                                
        <h3>~</h3> <br>
        
        <p>As Emerald went down the hall to Amy&apos;s room (which is where the diaries were kept) she accidentally bumped into Glissen, 
            her 13 year old sister, who had her own talk show and was usually VERY excitable.</p>  
        <p>&quot;Howdy, Em!&quot; Glissen chirped. </p> 
        <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; said Emerald uncertainly. </p> 
        <p>Glissen immediately looked interested. &quot;Whatcha doing? Seems like something&apos;s up,&quot; she declared.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Um, nothing, really,&quot; Emerald hedged.</p> 
        <p>Glissen shook her head. &quot;Nope. You have a look about you.&quot;</p> 
        <p>&quot;Look, I&apos;m sorry, but I need to go to Amy&apos;s room right now, so I have no time for talking,&quot; Emerald said. </p> 
        <p>&quot;You&apos;re going to Amy&apos;s room? But why?&quot; Glissen asked. </p> 
        <p>&quot;Because,&quot; said Emerald, straightening her skirt, &quot;I would like to look at Mom&apos;s diaries.&quot; </p> 
        <p>&quot;OK.&quot; said Glissen, &quot;But…&quot;</p> 
        <p>&quot;Mom&apos;s diaries aren&apos;t off limits, you know. We don&apos;t have to ask permission anymore,&quot; Emerald explained, 
            &quot;Amy said so.&quot; </p> 
        <p>&quot;Buuuuut, Glimmer said we can&apos;t touch them! And that we needed to ask permission for them if we wanted or needed to!
            &quot; Glissen protested. </p> 
        <p>&quot;Well, ever since Glimmer and Henry moved out, Amy has been taking charge,&quot; said Emerald, &quot;Which means we listen 
            to her now, and we follow her rules.&quot;</p>  
        <p>&quot;Ohhhh!&quot; said Glissen, &quot;Alright then!&quot; </p> 
        <p>&quot;Well, I want to look at those diaries! See you later!&quot; Emerald cried, and she quickly dashed off. </p> <br>
        
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>&apos;Phew! Lost her!&apos; Emerald thought once Glissen was out of sight. </p>
        <p>She went into Amy&apos;s room.  She opened the box that held their mother&apos;s diaries and just looked at them for a moment.</p> 
        <p>One caught her eye that was a beautiful amethyst purple leather, and was tied around with a shiny deep florescent pink ribbon. 
            Carefully, Emerald untied the ribbon and opened the diary. As she did, a dark purple card slipped out.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Oh my!&quot; said Emerald, picking up the card. &quot;&apos;Lascana?&apos;&quot; she read aloud curiously, &quot;What&apos;s 
            that?&quot; She flipped the card over. On the other side were the handwritten words:</p><br>
        
        <p>Tuesday 2 PM  Audition</p><br>
        
        <p>Audition? Emerald wondered. For what?</p>
        <p>At that moment, Glissen barged into the room.</p>
        <p>&quot;Em! Em!&quot; she cried, &quot;I need help with ideas for people to interview on &apos;Listen with Glissen&apos; so… can you?!
            &quot;</p> 
        <p>&quot;Yes, I can,&quot; Emerald replied. &quot;Hey, could you use your computer skills to find out what Lascana is?&quot; she asked, 
            showing her the card.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Or I could tell you,&quot; said a familiar voice. The two girls whipped their heads around to see… Amy!</p> 
        <p>&quot;You know what Lascana is?&quot; Glissen wondered. </p>
        <p>&quot;Yes, I do. Lascana is an old music club. A holdover from the jazz era that regained popularity as the place to go to see great 
            musical talent in Dazzle City. Mom used to visit it when she was a teen,&quot; Amy explained in a very thorough way.</p>
        <p>&quot;Did she... sing there?&quot; Emerald asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;I know she did a few times, before she met Dad.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Ooooohh!&quot; said Glissen. </p>
        <p>&quot;Is it still around?&quot; Em asked. </p>
        <p>&quot;Last I knew,&quot; said Amy. </p>
        <p>&quot;We should go and check it out!&quot; Glissen exclaimed. </p>
        <p>Emerald nodded in agreement. She was glad Glissen said something.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hmm, why not?&quot; Amy said.</p>
        <p>&quot;Maybe we&apos;ll find out something about Mom,&quot; Emerald added quietly.</p>
        <p>Amy and Glissen shrugged. &quot;Maybe,&quot; Amy repeated.</p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;m so excited!&quot; said Glissen. </p>
        <p>&quot;Me too!&quot; said Amy. </p>
        <p>&quot;Alright! Let&apos;s DO THIS!&quot; Glissen cried. </p>
        <p>&quot;Yeah!&quot; Emerald exclaimed in her sweet voice. </p>
        <p>&quot;Hm, a little louder next time, &apos;kay?&quot; Glissen asked. Em nodded, and the two sisters giggled. </p><br>
        
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>It was later in the day, and Glissen, Emerald, and Amy were getting prepared to visit the club.</p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad the weather cleared,&quot; Glissen remarked, as she brushed her hair.</p>
        <p>&quot;Lascana is an old-style club, that still follows the glamour days,&quot; Amy said, &quot;So we need to dress up. We want 
            to fit in.&quot;</p>
        <p>Of course, being Dazzles, the girls had plenty of things to choose from!</p> 
        <p>&quot;That blue looks beautiful on you, Emerald!&quot; exclaimed Glissen, &quot;But I know just the thing to really glam up your 
            look.&quot; She tossed a white boa around her sister&apos;s neck. &quot;There!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Are you sure it&apos;s not too much?&quot; Emerald looked worried as she considered her reflection in the mirror.</p>
        <p>&quot;I think it&apos;s just right,&quot; Amy gave her a kiss on the cheek. &quot;You&apos;ll fit right in.&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen considered their three reflections, and said, &quot;We can call ourselves the sparkle sisters tonight!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I like that! Now let&apos;s go,&quot; Amy jingled the car keys.</p><br>
        
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>The club was in a part of town that the girls weren&apos;t familiar with. It was dark, after supper, when they parked on a 
            side street, and looked for the entrance.</p>
        <p>&quot;Over there,&quot; Amy motioned. They could hear music coming from inside. &quot;I hope we didn&apos;t miss the evening 
            show,&quot; she said.</p>
        <p>Inside, it was quite dark! The music was louder, and as they were ushered into the room, they could see little round tables 
            with candles on them. Many of the seats were filled, and there was the sparkle of light glinting off sequins and gems.</p> 
        <p>Glissen let out a low whistle. &quot;Wow. I definitely do NOT feel overdressed,&quot; she said.</p> 
        <p>In the low light, faint smoke from the candles hung over the room, and they could see a small stage, where a woman was singing.</p> 
        <p>&quot;We should find a table,&quot; whispered Amy.</p>
        <p>&quot;Got it,&quot; Glissen said, and walked right in. Emerald&apos;s eyes widened, and she looked at Amy in alarm.</p>
        <p>Amy smiled reassuringly. &quot;Glissen&apos;s confidence in these situations might be what we need. Just follow her,&quot; she said.</p>
        <p>They went in, following Glissen as she wound her way between tables and patrons, all the way to an empty table near the corner 
            of the stage. They sat down and turned their attention to the singer.</p>
        <p>&quot;Her voice is beautiful!&quot; Emerald breathed. &quot;Ruby should be here!&quot;</p> 
        <p>The woman on the stage was mesmerizing. She was older, with her gray hair coiffed and held with a glittering comb. Her clothes 
            were not new, but there was an elegance about them that added to her charm. Her eyes closed as she sang the heartbreaking end 
            to the beautiful song. Applause smattered around the room in appreciation for the performance, and the woman smiled before 
            beginning another.</p><br>

        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2713.jpg" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>

        <p>The girls sat, enraptured by the woman&apos;s lovely voice and the deep, soulfulness she put into every song. It was very clear 
            that the people were here to hear her, by the way they sat, fixated. The whole room erupted in stronger applause as she took a 
            slight bow.</p>
        <p>&quot;Must be the end of her set,&quot; Emerald murmured.</p> 
        <p>Glissen hopped to her feet, clapping. </p>
        <p>&quot;Sit down, Glissen!&quot; Emerald tugged at her skirt. But Glissen stayed standing until the singer noticed, and with a 
            little smile, the woman made her way towards their table. </p>
        <p>&quot;I see I have some new fans,&quot; she smiled warmly as she held her hand out in greeting. </p>
        <p>Glissen took her hand between both of hers and hopped excitedly. &quot;Oh, do you ever!&quot; she said. </p>
        <p>Amy stood up. &quot;Please, won&apos;t you join us for a moment?&quot; she asked politely. </p>
        <p>The woman took a seat graciously. &quot;Why thank you. And who&apos;s company do I have the pleasure of?&quot;</p>
        <p>The girls introduced themselves.</p>
        <p>&quot;And my name is Riette Rose. I have been lucky to have had an interested audience here for many years. But,&quot; Riette 
            paused, &quot;Dazzle. What an interesting surname. I recall...&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald, Glissen and Amy leaned forward. Riette seemed lost in thought. What had she been about to say?</p>
        <p>&quot;Um, may I ask,&quot; Emerald began tentatively, &quot;Miss Rose, have you been singing here for a very long time?&quot;</p> 
        <p>&quot;Mmm hmm,&quot; Riette said. &quot;I have. And before I began singing, I used to frequent this place as a young girl. My 
            grandfather owned the club, you see,&quot; she explained.</p>
        <p>&quot;It must have been wonderful, seeing all the singers as a child,&quot; Amy commented.</p>
        <p>At the older woman&apos;s nod, Glissen asked, &quot;Is that what inspired you to sing?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Yes. Of course—people really knew how to sing in those days. Not that people today don&apos;t, but it was the style of 
            songs back then; letting the voice be the center of attention. The music didn&apos;t get in the way. You could truly hear and 
            feel the emotion and timbre of the singer&apos;s voice.&quot; Riette Rose laughed softly. &quot;But listen to me, going on 
            about the old days. You didn&apos;t come here for that!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, but we did!&quot; Glissen said exuberantly.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Yes, please tell us more,&quot; said Amy. &quot;When did you start singing? Did any of the performers here help you?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;What are your favorite memories? And do you own the club now?&quot; Glissen chimed in.</p>
        <p>Riette laughed. &quot;My, my! I am afraid my stories would keep you here all night! But—short version—yes, I own the Lascana now. 
            And yes, many of the great voices of my youth gave me excellent advice and tips. I have seen many performers here on this stage, 
            some on their way to great fame—&quot; she named a couple of famous entertainers that made the girls gasp, &quot;and some that 
            may have been even more talented, but chose a different path...sometimes that can be even more special. To be one of the few to 
            hear the exquisite voice...&quot;</p> 
        <p>Once again, Riette Rose seemed lost in memory.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Are you thinking of someone in particular?&quot; Emerald asked softly.</p><br>
        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2714.jpg" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>Nodding, Riette said quietly, &quot;One of the loveliest voices that I have ever heard. Pure and true. People packed the club 
            every night to hear her sing. But she was destined for more... I am not sure what...but when she left, I was incredibly 
            sad.&quot;</p>
        <p>Riette blinked a few times. &quot;You remind me of her,&quot; she said, looking at Emerald. &quot;Your quiet demeanor.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;And your face...so similar,&quot; Riette looked at Amy carefully. Then she turned to Glissen. &quot;And your determination. 
            All of you!&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald drew a deep breath. &quot;Her name—was it Aurora?&quot; she asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;Indeed it was,&quot; Miss Rose nodded. &quot;And you must be her daughters?&quot;</p>
        <p>All three girls nodded.</p> 
        <p>&quot;But why...&quot; Riette stopped mid-sentence and looked at them intently. &quot;There&apos;s more to it though, 
            isn&apos;t there?&quot; she said shrewdly. &quot;What happened?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Mom disappeared a long time ago,&quot; Emerald said sadly. &quot;When I was seven.&quot;</p>
        <p>Riette covered Emerald&apos;s hand with her own. &quot;Oh, my dear, I am so very sorry. You must miss her terribly.&quot; 
            She looked around the table at the girls. &quot;And here I thought you were here for a performance! But in fact, you must 
            be here to learn more of who your mother was.&quot; </p>
        <p>At the girl&apos;s nods, Riette stood up. &quot;Come with me. I have something to show you.&quot;</p><br>
        
        <p>The girls followed Riette backstage and down some steep stairs, through a narrow corridor. Riette opened a door with a 
            tarnished gold star on it.</p>
        <p>&quot;This was the dressing room your mother used,&quot; Riette said. She gestured widely. &quot;We shared it with two 
            other girls. When she left, she took nothing. Just left it all here. This is my dressing room now, but I haven&apos;t 
            gotten rid of anything of Aurora&apos;s. She was...a dear girl. It&apos;s all here,&quot; she showed them a trunk and 
            said, &quot;I think her daughters have a right to take it.&quot;</p>
        <p>The girls knelt in front of the trunk and carefully pulled out sequin dresses, satin shoes, bracelets, and necklaces, 
            even a box of very old lipsticks.</p>
        <p>Emerald held a soft cape to her cheek and sighed sadly. As she carefully folded it back into the trunk, she asked Riette, 
            &quot;Did you ever see Mom dance?&quot;</p>
        <p>Riette nodded. &quot;Aurora was extremely gifted. She sang on stage here, and danced at the old Grand Theatre, but here 
            in the dressing room, she would dance about to a little music box she brought with her.&quot; Riette turned to a little 
            dressing table. &quot;She left that, too. I keep it right here.&quot; </p>
        <p>On the table sat a lovely blue and white music box. Riette picked it up and wound it. As she set it back down, a lovely 
            tune tinkled out.</p><br>
            <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2720.jpg" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>Amy and Emerald looked at each other. &quot;Oh Em,&quot; Amy said, as Emerald&apos;s eyes filled with tears.</p> 
        <p>Suddenly, Amy gasped. &quot;I know that song! Mom used to have a music box that played the same song when I was little!&quot; 
            she exclaimed.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Interesting,&quot; said Riette.</p> 
        <p>&quot;She must have really liked that song,&quot; Glissen said.</p> 
        <p>&quot;I wonder if it&apos;s still around…&quot; said Amy.</p> 
        <p>&quot;I want you to have this,&quot; Riette put the still tinkling music box in Emerald&apos;s hands. Then she turned to 
            Amy and Glissen. &quot;Can I get a stagehand to help you with the trunk?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I think...&quot;Amy said slowly, &quot;I don&apos;t know, I feel like it belongs here...&quot; she looked at her 
            sisters.</p>
        <p>&quot;Me too,&quot; Emerald said, as Glissen nodded.
        <p>&quot;Well. Thank you. I love to have her things here.&quot; Riette smiled. &quot;And, please, anytime you&apos;d like 
            to look at them, please stop by.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, this is definitely not the last you&apos;ll see of us!&quot; Glissen said.</p>
        <p>&quot;My sister, Ruby—she&apos;s my twin—she loves to sing. I know she would love to hear you,&quot; said Emerald. 
            &quot;I can&apos;t wait to come back with her.&quot;</p>
        <p>Riette opened her arms wide and pulled all three girls in for a hug. </p>
        <p>&quot;I can&apos;t tell you how glad I am to meet you. It&apos;s quite late, you must get home. Please be safe—and do 
            come back.&quot;</p><br>
        
        <p>As the girls left the club, Emerald held the music box carefully.</p>
        <p>&quot;We know now that Mom used to be a chanteuse and a dancer. I wonder how many more surprises there are about 
            her?&quot; she mused.</p>
        <p>&quot;Me too,&quot; Amy said. &quot;But I kind of feel like we&apos;re at a dead end.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Dead end of what?&quot; asked Glissen.</p>
        <p>&quot;Of... leads to find out more about her, I guess,&quot; Amy replied, &quot;stuff we don&apos;t already know.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, what about the other music box?&quot; Glissen asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;What about it?&quot; Amy shrugged.</p>
        <p>&quot;I say we find it just to see,&quot; Glissen said adamantly. &quot;I mean, who knows what we might find along the 
            way!&quot;</p><br><br>
