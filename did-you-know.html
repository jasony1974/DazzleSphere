            <li>Dazzle is only her nickname? Her actual name is Violet Faye Dazzle.</li> 
            <li>As a kid, Violet loved the stars so much, she was always saying things like “the night sky is so dazzling 
                and I am a Dazzle! But do the stars dazzle anyone else in this family as much as they dazzle me? I must be 
                a true Dazzle.” So her sisters started calling her Dazzle Dazzle… and it stuck.</li>
            <li>Amy loved Mac & Cheese so much as a kid that she created her very first recipe, which she called “5 cheese macAmy” when she was 8.</li> 
            <li>Listen With Glissen started as videos of Glissen interviewing her sisters that she uploaded online? It became so popular that 
                Dazzle City Studios offered her a real show, and now she interviews famous artists from all over ⭐️</li>
            <li>Glossy attempted to build a treehouse when she was 9… and fell out of the tree. Luckily she escaped with only a sprained wrist!</li>
            <li>That as a kid, Diamond would dig around in the backyard hoping to find gemstones? She was grounded 3 different times in her attempts 
                to be “Archeologist Extraordinaire”</li>
            <li>Amy loves to ski- as do Francesca and Diamond! One of their favorite memories is the time they rented a chalet in the Alps for a weekend 
                and got snowed in for a week!</li>
