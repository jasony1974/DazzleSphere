            <p class="profile_p_odd"> Don’t let her sunny face fool you- this is one dastardly lady! 
                We’re not sure why, but Flora has been after the Dazzles on many occasions. She’s captured, 
                snatched, hi-jacked and shanghaied many a Dazzle - and doing some of her dirtiest work from 
                jail! Yes, she finally got locked up, and that’s where she’ll stay.  We hope...</a><br><br>
                Read about the first time the McEvils <a href="mcevils_strike.html">kidnapped</a> the Dazzles. </p>

            <p class="profile_p_even"> So THIS is how Flora was able to perpetrate evil deeds on the Dazzles 
                from jail— she used her daughter Carly! These two blonde baddies really dislike the Dazzles. 
                And while Flora may be the mastermind, Carly is the sneaky one. Dazzles, watch out - Carly is 
                comin’ to getcha! </p>

            <p class="profile_p_odd"> There are some new villains in town! We thought the McEvils were bad, 
                but the Havoc sisters are incorrigible. Meet Chaos and Madness Havoc. They have kind of a 
                <a href="#wreaking_havoc">backstory...</a> and these ladies have been all kinds of trouble for the Dazzles. They are especially 
                wily and have easily escaped being caught for all their nefarious feats! No one knows where they 
                came from, and no one has any leads on their hideout. But one thing is certain: they know the 
                Dazzle family holds secrets, and they’re determined to reveal them!</p>
