             <h1>The McEvils Strike!</h1>

             <p> <span class="caps">F</span> lora is on the Commerce & Business Board of Dazzle City. She thinks she's pretty important - and her 
                daughter, Carly is plenty big for her britches.  Carly thinks her mom is influential on the Dazzle City scene, so she takes some
                greivances she has about the Dazzles to her mother.  Carly complains: <br><br>
                “Why do those Dazzle Triplets have businesses and dreams come true while I don’t? I’m a year ahead of them in school, 
                yet we all graduated at the same time! Just because those three graduated one year early, shouldn’t mean they get to establish 
                businesses just yet!” Carly complained, “It’s so unfair!” 
                Then she looked slyly at her mother. <br><br>
                “How could three 18 year olds POSSIBLY be so successful without some unfair advantage? It’s preposterous!” Carly exclaimed. <br><br>
                “I thought the same thing when the board approved each of their businesses!” Flora told her daughter, “There is something about 
                those Dazzles and their family. Why are they so gifted? Nobody could REALLY be that smart!” <br><br>
                Flora kept thinking, and thinking. She couldn’t help but continue to blabber on about how the Dazzles bugged her.<br><br>
                “Do you think that there is a mystifying force behind the Dazzles’ success?” Flora asked. <br><br>
                “You mean a power that we could steal for ourselves and use for own success?” Carly asked. “But how do we get it?” <br><br>
                “Our name isn't McEvil for nothing! We start by finding out what these girls know...” said Flora. <br><br>
                And that is how the Dazzle Triplets got kidnapped. <br><br>
                <h1 class="section">*******</h1><br><br>
                “Where ARE we?” Glossy asks.<br><br>
                “I don’t know! What’s going on?” Francesca cries.<br><br>
                Diamond, Glossy and Francesca wake up to find themselves in a room with a wooden floor and walls. <br><br>
                “It seems we’ve been kidnapped,” Diamond says. “But why, I have no idea.”<br><br>
                “Is the door-?”<br><br>
                “Locked.” <br><br>
                “What’s up with the windows?” <br><br>
                Glossy taps at a window. “Seems like they’re covered on the outside.”<br><br>
                “Somebody’s coming!”<br><br>
                Flora enters the room, wearing a ski mask so they don’t know who she is.<br><br>
                “You’re not leaving here until you tell me what I need to know,” she says in a steely, evil voice.<br><br>
                The girls look at each other in alarm.<br><br>
                “Just be honest,” Diamond says. “We have nothing to hide.”<br><br>
                “Is that so?” Flora snarls. “Tell me, then, how is it that all three of you are so proficient at your young age? What’s your 
                secret?”<br><br>
                “Um... hard work?” Glossy offers.<br><br>
                Flora shakes her head. “You must have had help!”<br><br>
                “Oh! Yeah, well, my grandmother inspired me to design jewelry,” Diamond tells her.<br><br>
                “And she continues to provide you with enchanting designs?” <br><br>
                “Um, no. She’s dead. That would be creepy.”<br><br>
                “What explanation do you have for running successful businesses?”<br><br>
                “BUSINESS school?” Francesca looks at Flora like she’s a little wacky.<br><br>
                “Try again!” Flora sneers.<br><br>
                “No, really. We all went to summer business school together last year, when we realized that we wanted to open our own shops,” 
                Glossy explains.<br><br>
                “You three must have-“ Flora’s slightly crazed voice is suddenly interrupted by a lightening in the room followed immediately 
                by smashing glass.<br><br> 
                Everyone looks to see Cameron, Spangle, Glimmer and Amy outside the broken window!<br><br>
                “Come on! Let’s get out of here!”<br><br>
                Diamond, Glossy and Francesca are helped out through the window, and they escape safely!!!!<br><br>
                <h1 class="section">*******</h1><br><br>
                “How did you find us?” Glossy asks.<br><br>
                “Spangle and I were coming out of the coffee shop, and we saw you across the street, on your way to work. We saw a white van pull up 
                and some people jumped out and grabbed you!” Cameron told them.<br><br>
                “We called Glimmer, and she told us to follow the van,” Spangle explained.<br><br>
                “They took you all the way up here, to a cabin in the woods!” Amy exclaimed.<br><br>
                “What did they want?” Glimmer asks the Triplets.<br><br>
                “We don’t really know.” They all shrug. “It was like she thought we had some power that makes us successful.”<br><br>
                “You mean the power of hard work?” Spangle laughs.<br><br>
                “That’s what we told her! She wasn’t happy about that. So weird.”<br><br>
                <h1 class="section">*******</h1><br><br>
                “How DARE they tell us vicious LIES about their powers!” Flora exclaimed later that evening. <br><br>
                “I KNOW, right? They are DEFINITELY hiding something!” Carly agreed. <br><br>
                “Well, next time, we will be more sly and wily, and maybe not use your idea about kidnapping them randomly on the street, alright?” 
                Flora told her daughter smartly. <br><br>
                “MOOOOM!!” Carly cried. <br><br>
                <h1 class="section">*******</h1><br><br>
                Thus begins Flora and Carly McEvil's crusade against the Dazzles. When will they strike next?<br><br>
                <h1 class="section">THE END!!</h1><br><br>
