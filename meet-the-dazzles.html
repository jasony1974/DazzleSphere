        There's <strong>at least 16</strong> of them — and that's just the girls — the good ones at that.

        <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Glimmer</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_odd">As the oldest of the Dazzle sisters, Glimmer has had her hands full taking care of the family.
          But that's ok. She wouldn't have had it any other way. Family is everything to Glimmer! <br><br>

        <p class="profile_p_even">As the second oldest, Amy is stepping up to watch over the girls while Glimmer plans her wedding.
          And Amy has her own plans — she’s taken her skills in the kitchen and her passion for pasta to a new level: a cozy
          restaurant aptly named Amy’s Pasta. Now she needs to grow her business...</p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Sapphire</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_odd"> Meet Sapphire, a girl who writes. She loves writing stories about talking critters and things. She really is a writer —
          she just published her eighth children’s book! Sapphire’s love for writing has turned into a great big bubble of fun: her new comic series <a href="piggle-and-twit.html"><em>Piggle
            and Twit</em></a>, launched recently to rave reviews! </p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_even">Dazzle</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_even"> As a little girl, Dazzle was, well, dazzled, by the starry night sky. She’s learned a lot about the heavenly realm since.
          She’s read Hawking’s classic <em class="book-title">A Brief History of Time</em> twice and has even made her own telescope! She may be the one to
          discover the answers to the secrets of the Dazzle Universe. Wait, what secrets? </p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Crystal & Cameron</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_odd"> These twins are not so alike; in fact, they are quite opposites! Crystal’s gaze is firmly on fashion, whilst Cameron’s focus
          is in the science lab. They are both certainly useful though: Crystal is designing Glimmer’s wedding dress, and Cameron — well, every family this big
          needs a super intellectual. We’re sure she’ll come in handy.</p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_even">The Triplets</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_even">These girls are quite the entrepreneurs! At only 18, they have each worked hard to get a toehold in
          the business of their dreams. Recently, each one has made progress in Dazzle City’s business scene: </p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Francesca</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_odd"> ... such a gorgeous gal. And with a talent for interior design — the Dazzle Cottage was her vision — she is soon to be 
          <a href="old-news.html#beautiful_home">renowned</a> in the DazzleSphere. Watch out!</p>
      </div>

        <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Diamond.png" alt="Diamond">
        <h3 class="profile_label_even">Diamond</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_even"> Diamond loves diamonds. And rubies. And amethysts. And gold and silver- You name it, if it’s sparkles, she loves it!
          After years of designing jewelry for her many sisters, she’s taken her savvy to the heart of Dazzle City with her very own
          jewelry shop — Diamond’s Designs — where she can savor all things sparkly. Currently she is working on a one of a kind ring set
          commissioned by Glimmer's groom. </p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Glossy</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_odd"> Oh, the artful Glossy! This is one adventurous girl who doesn’t mind getting dirty. She's been exploring and playing hard
          since she was little. She’s also worked hard, and she’s learned a lot — from drawing and painting to pottery and sculpting. She's always looking for ways 
          to express her creative imagination! Her shop, Glossy Finishes, is quite popular with the arts and crafts crowd. </p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_even">Ruby & Emerald</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_even"> They look like twins… Because they are! They may seem shy at first, but they come alive when they share their many musical gifts.
          These are entertaining gems:</p>

        <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Ruby.png" alt="Ruby">
        <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Ruby</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_odd"> Ruby aspires to be a singer - and she just might make it soon, since her recent moment in the spotlight in London. She has
          a pretty regular gig singing at the Dazzle Music Hall in Dazzle City. But, why was she in London? Hmm...There’s a whole lot of stories to these Dazzles,
          so stay tuned!</p>

        <h3 class="profile_label_even">Emerald</h3>
        <p class="profile_p_even"> Emerald loves music too. She plays guitar in Ruby’s hometown band and she loves to dance. Of all the girls, Emerald misses her
          mom the most. She knows her mom was once a beautiful dancer, and Emerald is hoping to be one also. Is she talented enough to make center stage someday?
          And, what happened to the Dazzle’s mother<a href="dazzlestudioproductions.html#the_secret">?</a> </p>

          <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Lacey & Glissen</h3>
          <p class="profile_p_odd"> Until recently, we all thought Glissen was the youngest. And then Lacey appeared on the scene, and, turns out, she is the long
            lost twin Glissen never knew she had! </p>

          <h3 class="profile_label_even">Lacey</h3>
          <p class="profile_p_odd"> Lacey enters her sisters’ world with information about their parents. The girls immediately bond, but soon realize that there
            is much more to her than meets the eye. Lacey's life has been very different. And although she is hesitant to trust, she yearns for connection. Can 
            the girls give her the love and family stability she needs? One thing we know: Lacey's arrival reveals that there are mysteries afoot in the Dazzle family!</p>

          <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Glissen</h3>
          <p class="profile_p_odd"> Oh Glissen. So spunky, so silly - but she has a nose for news, and you can hear all about everything on her talk show <em>Listen
          With Glissen</em>. And when Lacey showed up, Glissen got to work and managed to find their birth certificate revealing that Lacey was born 11 minutes before
          Glissen. So Glissen is still the youngest! But wait, a 13 year-old with her own talk show? Yep. In the DazzleSphere anything is possible. Did you think it
          wasn’t? </p>

          <h3 class="profile_label_even">The Cousins</h3>
          <p class="profile_p_even"> Seriously, more girls to keep track of? Well, yes. (If you’re eight, this is no problem) Anyway, these girls are so gorgeous, they
            just have to be Dazzles. And they are dazzling also: <br><br>
            Grace loves to bake. Her craving for cakes has culminated in the creation of opening her own bakery, appropriately titled “Grace’s Cakes”. She’s been
            pretty secretive lately so we think she might be working on a special design for a wedding cake. <br><br>
            We don’t know much about Josephine other than that she seems to always be around for the Dazzles' adventures and to lend a helping hand wherever it’s needed.
            We’re sure there’s more to her than meets the eye though; with that long hair, she could almost pass for a mermaid...</p>

            <p class="profile_p_odd"> About time for some diversity, eh?  These girls are rare — which makes them extra special.  Meet Spangle and her sister, Primrose —
              besties of the Dazzles since they were young. <br><br>
              Spangle is a carpenter. She fixes roofs, windows, floors, walls- your whole house even! Her besties
              are Glimmer and Amy Dazzle, and she often works on projects with Glossy and Francesca. She loves
              the busy Dazzle household and how something is always happening there!<br><br>
              Quiet Primrose has spent many years at a boarding school in England, only returning last year. She
              loves fresh flowers and chocolate — in fact, her dream is to one day be a chocolatier with her own
              shop. She also wishes to go to many flower-themed festivities with her <a href="primrose-meets-lacey.html">best friend, Lacey</a> Dazzle.<br><br>
