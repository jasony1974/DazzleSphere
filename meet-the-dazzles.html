      <p class="profile_p_odd">As the oldest of the Dazzle sisters, Glimmer has had her hands full taking care of the family.
        But there is exciting news for Glimmer — now that the girls are getting older, she can finally have that wedding
        she’s been planning! Yes, Glimmer is getting married!</p>

      <p class="profile_p_even">As the second oldest, Amy is stepping up to watch over the girls while Glimmer plans her wedding.
        And Amy has her own plans — she’s taken her skills in the kitchen and her passion for pasta to a new level: a cozy
        restaurant aptly named Amy’s Pasta. Now she needs to grow her business...</p>

      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">The Triplets</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd">These girls are quite the entrepreneurs! At only 18, they have each worked hard to get a toehold in
        the business of their dreams. Recently, each one has made progress in Dazzle City’s business scene: </p>

      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Francesca</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_even"> ... such a gorgeous gal. And with a talent for interior design — the Dazzle Cottage was her vision — she is soon to be renowned

      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Diamond</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Diamond loves diamonds. And rubies. And amethysts. And gold and silver- You name it, if it’s sparkles, she loves it!
        After years of designing jewelry for her many sisters, she’s taken her savvy to the heart of Dazzle City with her very own
        jewelry shop — Diamond’s Designs — where she can savor all things sparkly. Currently she is working on a one of a kind ring set
        commissioned by Glimmer's groom. </p>

      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Oh, the artful Glossy! She used to be a tomboy, so this girl doesn’t mind getting dirty. She’s worked hard and she’s learned
        a lot—she didn’t stop at painting; she’s tried her hand at carpentry too! Her shop, Glossy Finishes, is quite popular with the
        arts and crafts crowd. </p>

        she just published her eighth children’s book! Sapphire’s love for writing has turned into a great big bubble of fun: her new comic series “Piggle
        and Twit,” launched recently to rave reviews! </p>

      <p class="profile_p_odd"> As a little girl, Dazzle was dazzled by the starry night sky. She’s learned a lot about the heavenly realm since — she
        even made her own telescope — and she may be the one to discover the answers to the secrets of the Dazzle Universe. Wait, what secrets?  </p>
