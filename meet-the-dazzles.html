      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Glimmer</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd">As the oldest of the Dazzle sisters, Glimmer has had her hands full taking care of the family.
        But there is exciting news for Glimmer — now that the girls are getting older, she can finally have that wedding
        she’s been planning! Yes, Glimmer is getting married!</p>

      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Amy</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_even">As the second oldest, Amy is stepping up to watch over the girls while Glimmer plans her wedding.
        And Amy has her own plans — she’s taken her skills in the kitchen and her passion for pasta to a new level: a cozy
        restaurant aptly named Amy’s Pasta. Now she needs to grow her business...</p>

      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">The Triplets</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd">These girls are quite the entrepreneurs! At only 18, they have each worked hard to get a toehold in
        the business of their dreams. Recently, each one has made progress in Dazzle City’s business scene: </p>

      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Francecsa.png" alt="Francesca">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Francesca</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_even"> ... such a gorgeous gal. And with a talent for interior design — the Dazzle Cottage was her vision — she is soon to be renowned
        in the DazzleSphere. Watch out!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_odd">
      <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Diamond.png" alt="Diamond">
      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Diamond</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Diamond loves diamonds. And rubies. And amethysts. And gold and silver- You name it, if it’s sparkles, she loves it!
        After years of designing jewelry for her many sisters, she’s taken her savvy to the heart of Dazzle City with her very own
        jewelry shop — Diamond’s Designs — where she can savor all things sparkly. Currently she is working on a one of a kind ring set
        commissioned by Glimmer's groom. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_even">
      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Glossy.png" alt="Glossy">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Glossy</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Oh, the artful Glossy! She used to be a tomboy, so this girl doesn’t mind getting dirty. She’s worked hard and she’s learned
        a lot—she didn’t stop at painting; she’s tried her hand at carpentry too! Her shop, Glossy Finishes, is quite popular with the
        arts and crafts crowd. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_odd">
      <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Sapphire.png" alt="Sapphire">
      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Sapphire</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Meet Sapphire, a girl who writes. She loves writing stories about talking critters and things. She really is a writer —
        she just published her eighth children’s book! Sapphire’s love for writing has turned into a great big bubble of fun: her new comic series <em>Piggle
        and Twit</em>, launched recently to rave reviews! </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_even">
      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Dazzle.png" alt="Dazzle">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Dazzle</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> As a little girl, Dazzle was, well, dazzled, by the starry night sky. She’s learned a lot about the heavenly realm since.
        She’s read Hawking’s classic <em class="book-title">A Brief History of Time</em> twice and has even made her own telescope! She may be the one to
        discover the answers to the secrets of the Dazzle Universe. Wait, what secrets? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_odd">
      <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Ruby_Emerald.png" alt="Ruby & Emerald">
      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Ruby & Emerald</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> They look like twins… Because they are! These are entertaining gems:
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_even">
      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Ruby.png" alt="Ruby">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Ruby</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Ruby aspires to be a singer - and she just might make it soon, since her recent moment in the spotlight in London. She has
        a pretty regular gig singing at the Dazzle Music Hall in Dazzle City. But, why was she in London? Hmm...There’s a whole lot of stories to these Dazzles,
        so stay tuned!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_odd">
      <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Emerald.png" alt="Emerald">
      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Emerald</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Emerald loves music too. She plays guitar in Ruby’s hometown band and she loves to dance. Of all the girls, Emerald misses her
        mom the most. She knows her mom was once a beautiful dancer, and Emerald is hoping to be one also. Is she talented enough to make center stage someday?
        And, what happened to the Dazzle’s mother? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_even">
      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Crystal_Cameron.png" alt="Crystal & Cameron">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Crystal & Cameron</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> These twins are not so alike; in fact, they are quite opposites! Crystal’s gaze is firmly on fashion, whilst Cameron’s focus
        is in the science lab. They are both certainly useful though: Crystal is designing Glimmer’s wedding dress, and Cameron -well, every family this big
        needs a super intellectual. We’re sure she’ll come in handy.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_odd">
      <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Lacey_Glissen.png" alt="Lacey & Glissen">
      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Lacey & Glissen</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Until recently, we all thought Glissen was the youngest. And then Lacey appeared on the scene, and, turns out, she is the long
        lost twin Glissen never knew she had! </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_even">
      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/Lacey.png" alt="Lacey">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">Lacey</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Lacey enters her sisters’ world with information about their parents. The girls immediately bond, and they see that Lacey is
        obsessed with weddings and marriage. Could it be because of her life until now? Can her sisters give her the love and family stability she needs?
        One thing's for sure: Lacey is a terrific wedding planner!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_odd">
      <img class="profile_pic_odd" src="images/Glissen.png" alt="Glissen">
      <h3 class="profile_label_odd">Glissen</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Oh Glissen. So spunky, so silly - but she has a nose for news, and you can hear all about everything on her talk show <em>Listen
        With Glissen</em>. A 13 year old with her own talk show? Yep. In the DazzleSphere anything is possible. Did you think it wasn’t? </p>
    </div>

    <div class="profile_row_even">
      <img class="profile_pic_even" src="images/cousins.png" alt="The Cousins">
      <h3 class="profile_label_even">The Cousins</h3>
      <p class="profile_p_odd"> Seriously, more girls to keep track of? Well, yes. (Grown-up aside: If you’re an eight year old girl, this is no problem).
        Anyway, these girls are so gorgeous, they just have to be Dazzles. And they are dazzling also: Grace loves to bake. Her craving for cakes has culminated
        in the creation of opening her own bakery, appropriately titled “Grace’s Cakes”. She’s been pretty secretive lately so we think she might be working on
        a special design for a wedding cake. And Josephine...</p>
