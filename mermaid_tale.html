        <h1>Mermaid Tale</h1>

          <p>“Bye!” Josephine waved as Grace unlocked the door to her bakery. She put the car in reverse and headed 
            down the street. It was early morning, and light was just beginning to spread over the sleepy city. There 
            wasn't much movement, other than a few other businesses that began their workday early as Grace did.
          </p>
          
          <p>She headed away from the city, toward the coast. It was so peaceful at this time of day. As she turned 
            onto a coastal road everything grew lighter and lighter. She opened her window and the smell of the ocean 
            wafted in. After a little while, she turned off on a smaller road that wound closer and closer towards the 
            ocean. It ended at a little dirt clearing, and Josephine parked the car. She could smell the sweet scent of 
            beach roses as she walked down a little path, through dew-wet branches and tiny cobwebs that spiders had 
            started overnight.
          </p>
          
          <p>The path led to a small beach. Josephine slid her sandals off her feet and curled her toes in the silky 
            sand. She knew the water would be cold, but she didn't mind. She took a deep breath, lifting her chin to the 
            now-blue sky. A little breeze swirled around the tiny beach and lifted her hair. She exhaled and stepped 
            purposefully into the water.
          </p>
          
          <p>It was time to go to work.</p>
          
          <p>With a few quick steps, the water was over her knees, and she turned and fell backwards into the water 
            with a splash and a gleeful shriek. Wiggling her feet, she looked down, and saw her bright shiny tail catch 
            a first ray of the sun's early light. Then with a small splash, she took off towards the lighthouse.</p>
          
          <p>Her head popped out of the water, and she looked around. She was surprised to hear voices. Why were there 
            people here, especially at this time of day? This was going to make her mission harder.
          </p>
          
          <p>She looked around and saw some college kids and a couple of small tents. It seemed they were packing up. 
            Josephine gulped. She sneezed the water out of her nose, and her tail instantly disappeared.</p>
          
          <p>She made her way through the morning waves towards the island bay. Josephine slowly scrambled onto the rocky 
            coast. She looked around to see if the college students saw her. Luckily none of them did. The wind had picked 
            up and was gusting around the tiny island. The students were struggling with their tent as they tried to pack 
            it up. Josephine's hair blew right into her face, making it hard for her to climb up the rocks.</p>
          
          <p>Where was the door, in the lighthouse? It must be on the other side. Could she sneak past them? It was a risk 
            she'd have to take.</p>
          
          <p>Tying her hair into a bun, she kept low to the ground. As she got close to the lighthouse, she clung to the 
            wall and inched along it towards the other side. Reaching the door, Josephine realized it was locked. It was 
            a rusty padlock, and it didn't look very sturdy. She could probably break it open. She looked around for a rock, 
            but seeing it was back out in the open, she got down on all fours, and sneaked her way back to the shore. Finally, 
            as she had obtained a rock that was big enough, she sneaked back to the door. Once there, Josephine hit the 
            padlock a few times and finally, it broke off. Once the door was open, she hurried inside.</p>
          
          <p>Inside, Josephine looked for a loose plank in the floor, or maybe even a trap door, but she didn't see any. It 
            wasn't very bright in here. She could see the stairs that went up the tower, and there was a little window that 
            let in a bit of light partway up. She looked around some more, blinking to get used to the dark better. Then she 
            noticed a small door in the wall. A closet?  There wasn't a knob.</p>
          
          <p>Sliding her hand over the surface along the edge of the door, her fingers found an indent. Hooking her finger 
            into it, a latch popped out, and she realized it was a door-pull. Carefully opening the door, she saw steps. OK. 
            Not a closet.</p>
          
          <p>If she thought it was dark on the first floor, there was absolutely no light here. She willed her mermaid eyes 
            to see in the dark. Could she do it?</p>
          
          <p>Yes! The steps came into focus, and she carefully made her way down, finding an actual basement. But there was 
            no whale oil anywhere. Then she remembered  that there might be room <i>beneath</i> the floor. And she looked again 
            for a loose plank or trap door.</p>
          
          <p>Eureka!  She saw the unmistakable outline of a trapdoor, complete with a big metal ring to open it. She pulled on 
            the ring, and it opened easily. Would there be rats in there? Suddenly, she heard voices coming from above.</p>
          
          <p>"Wow, can you believe it? The door is open! Wasn't it locked last night?” said one of the voices.</p>
          
          <p>“Um, YES. But the lock has been broken. Did one of you do it?” said another voice.</p>
          
          <p>“No.”</p>
          
          <p>“Nope!”</p>
          
          <p>“But why would Lizzie dare us to do this when she already knew it was locked? Maybe <i>she</i> did it?" </p>
          
          <p>“Or there's someone else on the island with us.”</p>
          
          <p>“Get upstairs and take the picture and let's get out of here, yeah?”</p>
          
          <p>Josephine heard a scurrying of feet as the kids beat it up the stairs. Phew! But now she was really in a hurry. 
            Looking through the trap door, she saw that she'd have to climb down in there, so with a gulp, in she went.</p>
          
          <p>There! <b>Lots</b> of jars of whale oil. Hooking her finger through the handle of one of the brown jugs, she climbed  
            out and fled back upstairs out of the basement. Quietly closing the basement door, she crept out of the lighthouse and 
            down to a rocky cliff and jumped off, landing in the water with a big splash.</p>
          
          <p>Her shimmering green and blue tail formed under the water as her bun disappeared and turned into her regular, blonde hair, 
            just with streaks of green instead of brown. She popped her head out of the water to see if anyone had seen her. Then she 
            gasped.</p>
          
          <p>Up in the lighthouse, at the top, were the campers. Josephine quivered as she watched them. Then one of the kids pointed 
            down at the sea, where Josephine was. Was she pointing at her? Josephine dived under the water.</p>
          
          <p>Josephine swam as fast as she could to get away before the campers saw her. She needed to get to safety, and quick! Fear 
            of being seen made her swim faster than she ever had, which might be good for all the tests her employer was putting her 
            through.</p>
        
          <p></p>
          
          <h1>~</h1>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <p>Josephine swam like lightning through the clear blue water. She swam through schools of fish, and past various groups of 
            coral. Water bubbles blew against her face, popping one after another as she swam.</p>
          
          <p>At last, she came to a dark tunnel in a small, isolated reef, way away from the Dazzle City shore. She smiled. It was time 
            to go in.</p>
          
          <p>She swam through the opening to the tunnel that would take her to the Headquarters. She was about as safe as she could be, 
            in here. It was pretty dark in the tunnel, but she had excellent eyesight in the dark water. She came up to a wire doorway 
            that was locked. As she put in the code, the door opened, and swam through, knowing it would automatically shut behind her. 
            The tunnel gave way to solid concrete, and she was close. A little further on, she saw the ripple of water, where she knew her 
            boss was waiting. As her head came out of the water, sure enough, there she was.</p>
          
          <p>Cameron.</p>

          <p></p>
          
          <h1>~</h1>
          
          <p></p> 

          <p>Josephine sneezed, turning herself back into a human. She climbed out of the round metal pool in the floor, looking straight 
            up at Cameron.</p>
          
          <p>“Did you get it?” Cam asked.</p>
          
          <p>Josephine nodded.</p>
          
          <p>“I was getting worried. Did you run into trouble?”</p>
          
          <p>"Almost. Some college kids at the lighthouse just about saw me. I was so scared and I swam so fast, I reached the tunnel in no 
            time," said Josephine.</p>
          
          <p>"I'm sorry you almost got caught, but I'm glad you were able to get away so fast. It proves the tests I've put you through have 
            really helped," said Cam.</p>
          
          <p>"Say, are there any more tests coming up?" asked Josephine.</p>
          
          <p>"Not soon, looks like. You've been doing pretty well so far," Cameron said.</p>
          
          <p>"I still can't believe it's already been a year since you came up with idea of a PORTAL TO DAZZLETOPIA," said Josephine, "You're 
            pretty smart."</p>
          
          <p>"Well, we need to find Mom—I mean Aurora—no matter what," said Cam.</p>
          
          <p>"Hey. It's okay to call her Mom. She is your mom, after all," said Josephine warmly to Cameron.</p>
          
          <p>"Thanks. You're a pretty good cousin, Jo," said Cam appreciatively.</p>
          
          <p>She then turned to a table filled with beakers, cups, and all sorts of what-not filled with strange, brightly colored water. She 
            grabbed a beaker filled with green water and placed it under a microscope.</p>
          
          <p>"Where should I put the oil?" asked Josephine.</p>
          
          <p>"Umm, over there is fine," said Cam, pointing to the far right corner of the table, "I'll use it later, when my machine is finished."</p>
          
          <p>"It's still not finished? Do you need a certain part in order to finish it?" asked Josephine, "And, do you need me to get it?"</p>
          
          <p>"Yes, yes, and yes. The certain part I need you to get is hidden deep in the abandoned Smith Technologies Science Lab. It's a 
            microchip that holds all the electrical power and energy that will power my machine. Since the lab is abandoned, you should have no 
            problem retrieving the microchip," explained Cameron, "I'll need it by tomorrow, got it?"</p>
          
          <p>"Got it," said Josephine, and she dove back into the metal pool.</p>
          
          <p>Josephine swam through the water at lightning speed, breaking through the schools of fish that where swimming along. She loved the 
            feel of them brushing against her face as she swam. Suddenly, just as she was enjoying the sights of coral around her, she saw what 
            looked like a wreckage at the bottom of the sea.</p>
          
          <p>She dipped her head down as she swam towards the wreckage. Josephine stopped mid-swim to admire the beautiful scenery before 
            continuing. The wreckage looked quite intact despite being at the bottom of the ocean.</p>
          
          <p>“Now's the time to go to work!” said Jo as she dived down into the wreckage. She almost felt like walking on the seafloor despite 
            being underwater. The wreckage looked like it had never sunk! “Amazing...!” Jo breathed.</p>
          
          <p>Suddenly, she heard the clatter of pots and pans and then a small beep! which sounded like it was coming from a nearby kitchen. 
            Josephine swam down a seaweed-covered hallway until she found a nicely smelling kitchen.</p>
          
          <p>Josephine swam into the kitchen and gasped. Inside was her sister Grace! And she was baking CUPCAKES! Josephine swam over.</p>
          
          <p>“Grace, what are you doing on the bottom of the ocean? And, why are you baking?” Josephine asked.</p>
          
          <p>Then she realized that Grace should not see her tail, so she hid it behind her back as she waited for Grace to respond.</p>
          
          <p>“Oh, me? I'm just baking cupcakes, that's all,” Grace said as she gestured to the kitchen walls, “And isn't this kitchen so 
            refreshing? Whoever made this kitchen MUST have put an air conditioner in here, just for hot days like these!”</p>
          
          <p>"Why is she acting like she's not underwater?" Josephine thought.</p>
          
          <p>Suddenly, she felt her tail start to move away from its hiding place. Josephine gasped, but then she realized—she and Grace are 
            sisters, so it's okay if she knows.</p>
          
          <p>“Grace, I'm a mermaid,” Josephine blurted.</p>
          
          <p>“Oh, really? I never knew! Here, have a cupcake!” Grace smiled and carefully handed Josephine a cupcake before saying, “And yet 
            we're above water!”</p>
          
          <p>Josephine was about to say they weren't when she felt herself start to choke. There seemed to be something in her cupcake that 
            she caught when she bit into it. She looked at Grace. What was in this cupcake?</p>
          
          <p>She spit out her bite of cupcake to see what was in it. Then she saw it. There, sitting amongst slobbery bits of cupcake, was 
            the microchip that Cam needed.</p>
          
          <p>“HUZZAH!” Josephine cried.</p>
          
          <p>Grace looked up. She stared at Jo. Then she said: “You've been acting quite strange ever since you entered the kitchen. Do you 
            need to leave?”</p>
          
          <p>“Grace, the thing is, I—”  Josephine suddenly felt herself being teleported back to Headquarters—inside the kitchen in the wreck—
            while talking to Grace.</p>
          
          <p>“Um, goodbye, I guess?” Josephine squeaked as she disappeared from the kitchen and then reappeared in the metal pool back at HQ.</p>
          
          <p>Josephine looked around, and sure enough, there was Cameron, smiling at a long lumpy row that was covered by a humongous 
            tablecloth.</p>
          
          <p>“M-MAFOOIE!” Josephine sneezed before climbing out of the metal pool.</p>
          
          <p>“Ah, you're back,” said Cameron quietly.</p>
          
          <p>“That's right,” Josephine nodded as she walked towards Cameron.</p>
          
          <p>“Do you have the microchip?” Cameron asked, suddenly charging at Josephine.</p>
          
          <p>“Y-Yes, I do!” Josephine stuttered.</p>
          
          <p>“Good!” Cameron snatched the microchip from Josephine's hand.</p>
          
          <p>She then walked over to the humongous tablecloth and pulled it off to reveal...a row of robot-dazzles! Josephine's jaw dropped.</p>
          
          <p>“This is my new invention—Robot-Dazzles that will destroy Dazzle City!” Cameron laughed crazily as Josephine stared.</p>

          <p>“WHAA-AA-AT?!” Josephine felt her voice starting to crack.</p>

          <p>“MWAHAHAHA!” Cameron cackled.</p>

          <p>“But, weren't you going to look for your mom?” asked Josephine, her normal, uncracked voice returning.</p>

          <p>“Nope! That was a lie. THIS is my TRUE plan! AHAHA!” Cameron laughed evilly.</p>

          <p>“NOOOOO!!” Josephine shrieked.</p>

          <p>And she woke up.</p>

          <p>Josephine looked around her bedroom to see various objects lying around—the pile of clothes on her floor, her dresser stacked 
            with college applications and mermaid drawings, her bedside table complete with her cute blue and green clock and mermaid lamp, 
            and her closed-up closet in the corner. Josephine pulled off her covers to reveal...her legs.</p>

          <p>There was absolutely no sign of a tail ANYWHERE. Josephine scratched her forehead. WHAT had just happened? Was it all really 
            just a dream?</p>
            
          <p>She went downstairs and found Grace in the kitchen as usual, baking away.</p>

          <p>“You're up early,” her sister commented, as she cracked an egg into a bowl.</p>
          
          <p>Josephine rubbed her temple as she looked at the time.</p>
          
          <p>“Um, yeah. I had the weirdest dream,” she started, then yawned.</p>
          
          <p>“Oooo, I love weird dreams! Do you remember it well enough to tell me?”</p>
          
          <p>“Well, for starters, I was a mermaid,” Jo said. “And no one even thought it was unusual.”</p>
        
          <p>Grace stopped mid-crack with an egg in the air. “A mermaid!” She finished cracking the egg and looked sideways at Josephine.</p> 
          
          <p>“See? Strange, huh? In my dream that's how I thought you'd react. Anyway,” Josephine picked an orange out of a bowl on the 
            counter and started peeling it. “I was doing some deep sea errands for Cameron. She had a secret lab.”</p>

          <p>Grace whisked sugar into her eggs.  “I wonder if Cameron does have a secret lab. Do you?”</p>

          <p>Josephine blinked. “Well I never did before! She was working on some crazy projects—first a portal to someplace where she 
            thought her mom was, then some city destroying robots.”</p>

          <p>Grace laughed. “You should tell her. What a fun dream!”</p>

          <p>“Yeah, I guess,” Josephine said.</p>

          <p>There was a tap on the door, and Crystal came in. She stopped short when she saw Josephine.</p>

          <p>“Morning Jose. You're up early.” Crystal set her keys down on the table.</p>

          <p>Josephine munched her orange. “As are you. What brings you here so bright and early?”</p>

          <p>“I wanted her to try out a new flavor I was thinking of for the Open House,” Grace answered for her cousin. “But I'm a little 
            behind. Can you stay for a little bit?” she raised her eyebrows at Crystal.</p>

          <p>“Sure,” Crystal answered.</p>

          <p>Josephine popped the last of the orange into her mouth. “I'll let you guys get to it then. Bye!” And she hurried back to her 
            room.</p>

          <p>It was still quite early. Perhaps she could catch Cameron before she went to work. There was just..something...about her dream...</p>

          <p>Leaving her long hair in the braid that she usually slept in to keep it from tangling, she threw on yesterday's clothes that 
            were on the chair next to her bed. Trotting down the stairs, she bypassed the kitchen and tossed a “Be back in a bit!” to her sister, 
            and headed out the door.</p>

          <p>When she got to the Dazzle Mansion, she didn't go inside; she headed straight to Cameron's laboratory, which had its' own entrance. 
            The door was open, which meant Cameron was probably inside. Letting herself in, she called “Hello hello!” to warn Cam of her presence. 
            There was no answer. As she rounded the corner into the brightly lit lab, she saw Cam at her desk. She was scribbling some notes.</p>

          <p>“Good morning,” Jo said quietly.</p>

          <p>“Morning,” Cam said distractedly. She got up from her desk and went over to a bench with beakers and a microscope on it. She selected 
            a beaker and tipped it,  dropping a bead of fluid onto a glass plate which she then slid under the microscope. Only then did she look up 
            at Josephine.</p>

          <p>“Hey. How are you?”</p>

          <p>Josephine smiled. “I'm good. Except,” she hopped up on a stool that was nearby, “I had this crazy dream that I'd like to get your input 
            on.”</p>

          <p>“Shoot. Although you do know that dreams aren't omens; they're just your subconscious thoughts storing and discarding your experiences 
            and preserving your long term memories, right?”</p>

          <p>Josephine smacked her lips. “Right,” she agreed, although not certain if she did.</p>

          <p>“Anyway, your dream?” Cameron encouraged her, before going back to her microscope.</p>

          <p>“Yeah, well, in this dream, I was a mermaid,” she started.</p>

          <p>“Impossible,” Cameron said, not looking up. “The concept of mermaids, let alone of humans being able to turn into mermaids, is complete 
            fantasy and fiction. The way TV glamorizes the act of human flesh morphing into fish scales has given way  to too many simple minds the 
            idea that such ridiculous things are plausible. Mermaids, along with unicorns, belong where they started—as the stuff of imagination.”</p>

          <p>“Unicorns?” Josephine found herself saying stupidly.</p>

          <p>“Aren't real.” Cameron still hadn't looked up. “Unless referring to the rhinoceros.”</p>

          <p>“O-kay,” Josephine said. This wasn't about her actually believing fairytale stuff. “So in my dream—”</p>

          <p>“With you as a mermaid,” Cameron supplied.</p>

          <p>“—I was working for you, collecting stuff for your inventions.” Josephine watched Cameron, but she didn't move from the microscope. “I 
            got some whale oil from an old lighthouse—”</p>

          <p>“Like there'd be any left, after all these years,” Cam muttered.</p>

          <p>“—and a microchip to complete your invention of a portal to reach your mother.”</p>

          <p>“A portal?” For the first time, Cameron looked up from her microscope. “A portal...”</p>

          <p>Josephine waited. After a few moments, she said, “Can you believe it? You were hoping to find your mother, in some crazy place called 
            DazzleTopia.”</p>

          <p>Cameron was staring straight ahead, as if seeing something no one else could.</p>

          <p>“Also, you were going to destroy Dazzle City with some robots that looked like us.”</p>

          <p>That made Cameron turn her head. She looked at Josephine with a 'you've got to be kidding' look. Then she went over to her computer.</p>

          <p>“Thank you for telling me about your dream; it gives me some ideas,” she said as she tapped away at her computer.</p>

          <p>“Wait just a second, “Josephine said. “Are saying it's true?”</p>

          <p>“Mermaids? No. We've already been through this. City-destroying robots? C'mon. And a microchip that stores a significant electrical 
            energy? Obviously this was a dream.”</p>

          <p>“I mean about your mother,” Josephine said. “Do you really think she's alive?”</p>

          <p>Cameron turned away from the computer and looked at Josephine.</p>

          <p>“Yes.”</p>

          <p>Josephine drew in a sharp breath.</p>

          <p>“She just disappeared, Jo. No trace left behind. No ransom note, no nothing. But she was working on Dad's stuff that day. Do you know 
            what technology he was working on?”</p>

          <p>Josephine shook her head.</p>

          <p>“Groundbreaking, top secret...stuff. I'm still trying to figure it out, but it seems I'm missing some information.” Cam shrugged. 
            “Maybe she took it with her. But,” she brightened, “A portal. That might be the answer.”</p>

          <p>“I feel like my mind is exploding,” Josephine said.</p>

          <p>“Yes, well.” Cameron turned back to her computer. “Can you not make a big deal of this? It's only a working theory, and I wouldn't 
            want to get my sisters' hopes up. Dazzle is the only one I've discussed this with.”</p>

          <p>“You have my word,” Josephine said seriously.</p>

          <p>Cameron nodded. “Thanks.”</p>

          <p>Josephine hopped down off the stool.  “Time for coffee.  I'll see you later. Oh,” she paused on her way out. “Do you have a secret 
            lab?”</p>

          <p>Cameron looked up and stared at her. Jo raised her eyebrows. “Does that mean...?”</p>

          <p>Cameron didn't say anything. She just continued to stare at her. Josephine started to feel uncomfortable.</p>

          <p>“Well anyway, you did in my dream. So I wondered. K, bye!”</p>

          <p>Cameron didn't answer her, she just went back to her computer.</p>

          <p>“Wow,” Josephine thought as she closed the door behind her. That cousin of hers could be seriously intimidating.</p>

          <p></p>
          
          <h1>~</h1>
          
          <p></p> 
          
          <p>Josephine returned home, deep in thought. Who knew that Cameron and Dazzle had been thinking Aurora was alive all this time? Could 
            it even be true? One thing was for sure: if Aurora was alive, Cameron and Dazzle would be the ones to figure it out. The brain power 
            between those two was astronomical.</p>

          <p>She climbed the steps to her house slowly.  And just a silly dream had revealed this!</p>

          <p>“I'm back,” she said, going into the kitchen.</p>

          <p>“Great, just in time to try this version of my new recipe,” Grace turned to her with a smile.</p>

          <p>Josephine eyed the cupcake warily. “Anything, uh, interesting in it?”</p>

          <p>“Lemon cream. Crystal liked it. But she really hated the savory wasabi recipe! So I don't think I'll do that again.”</p>

          <p>Josephine swallowed the little cupcake in two bites. “Mmm, delicious!” she licked her fingers. “I'm gonna go shower and change now.”</p>

          <p>Turning on the water for the shower, Josephine thought about her dream. Imagine if she could turn into a mermaid! Then she remembered 
            Cam's human flesh to fish scales remark. Ew. She'd leave her mermaid dreams right there—in her dreams. But right now she needed clean 
            clothes. She crossed her room to her closet, opened the wardrobe door, and gasped.</p>

          <p>Hanging inside was a beautiful, shimmering green and gold mermaid tail.</p>
