        <p>They actually were allowed to take the shell – after much paperwork, documenting who they were and where 
            it was going.</p>
        <p>Once they got home, all of the Dazzle family gathered around the shell. Amy had filled them in about what 
            had led them to find it, and why it seemed to be a valuable connection to their mother.</p>
        <p>&quot;See what happens when Emerald sings!&quot; Glissen cried, and they all watched in amazement as the shell 
            produced a lovely light glow as Em hummed. </p>
        <p>&quot;Who wants to try next?&quot; Amy asked. &quot;It doesn&apos;t work for me or Glissen.&quot; She hummed. 
            &quot;See?&quot;</p>
        <p>Diamond whistled.</p>
        <p>Sapphire and Crystal hummed.</p>
        <p>Glossy tried la-la-laa-ing.</p>
        <p>Nothing happened.</p>
        <p>But when Ruby hummed, the shell produced its glow.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hmm,&quot; Amy said.</p>
        <p>&quot;Magic!&quot; Glissen breathed.</p>
        <p>&quot;Science!&quot; Cameron said.</p>
        <p>&quot;Huh?&quot; They all looked at Cameron.</p>
        <p>&quot;I have a theory,&quot; Cameron told them. </p>
        <p>They all looked at Cameron expectantly.</p>
        <p>&quot;First, let&apos;s make sure everyone has had a go at the tune,&quot; she started, &quot;Francesca, 
            Glimmer? Hum or whistle away!&quot;</p>
        <p>So, Francesca, then Glimmer, then each of the rest of the sisters -including Cameron - tried out the tune.</p>
        <p>From time to time, the shell flickered. But it never lit up fully.</p>
        <p>Cameron nodded. &quot;My theory may be correct. But I need to do more research. May I take this for testing?&quot;</p>
        <p>All of the sisters agreed. They trusted Cameron.</p>
        <p>Emerald followed Cameron to the lab. &quot;May I...just sit here and watch?&quot; she asked her sister.</p>
        <p>&quot;Of course! It may be boring though; I&apos;m going to run some tests. Although it seems like nothing&apos;s 
            happening, I&apos;ll actually be gathering data that might give us answers.&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald perched on a stool and arranged her skirt. She watched as Cameron placed the shell in a box that appeared 
            to be some sort of machine that spit out information on Cam&apos;s computer screen. Then Cam moved the shell to 
            her work desk under an extremely bright light. She examined it closely for a while, before moving it to yet another 
            box. Emerald thought that it might be some sort of X Ray machine.</p><br>
        <img src="/images/dazzles_secret/img_4640.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>

        <p>As the time passed, Emerald thought about the past few days. A lot had happened. What had started out as homesickness 
            for her mom,  turned into meeting Riette, and finding out that her mother, Aurora, with her beautiful voice, had been 
            a popular singer at the Lascana. She thought about the music box that Riette gave her, that sat on her bedside table. 
            The past two nights she had wound it before turning out the lights. Listening to the sweet tinkle as the song played 
            over and over was comforting. It felt wonderful having something of her mum&apos;s. </p>
        <p>The music box reminding Amy of another music box, which led them on a further adventure, was amazing. Finding a cryptic 
            note about an artifact in a library... and now here they were, with a mysterious shell, that had something to do with 
            that tune in the music box. Emerald blinked. But what?</p>
        <p>&quot;Got it.&quot; Cameron&apos;s voice interrupted Emerald&apos;s thoughts. She looked up.</p>
        <p>Cameron was standing in front of her, holding the shell. &quot;At least part of the mystery is solved,&quot; she said. 
            &quot;Let&apos;s go find the others.&quot;</p>
        <p>Once again, all of the sisters gathered around the shell. Cameron waited until everyone was quiet, and then she began, 
            with a touch of drama:</p>
        <p>&quot;It isn&apos;t a real seashell—it only looks like one,&quot; and a few of her sisters gave little gasps of surprise. </p>
        <p>&quot;It is actually some sort of box—with a mechanical lock that&apos;s programmed to open by sound. Think of it like a 
            key—with the correct key, you can open a lock. This lock requires a specific tune.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;But, we all sang the tune, and it only lit up for Em and Ruby!&quot; Diamond said.</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, some of us sang the tune,&quot; said Dazzle. &quot;It was kind of unrecognizable from a lot of us!&quot; </p>
        <p>Cameron nodded. &quot;Remember how a key works—each lock needs a specific key; not one that&apos;s close. This shell is 
            looking for an exact bunch of notes, and—&quot; she looked at Amy, who was acting as if a light bulb had appeared over 
            her head. &quot;Want to tell us, Amy?&quot;</p>
        <p>Amy practically bounced with excitement. &quot;It&apos;s because Ruby and Em have perfect pitch! Mom trained them! She 
            spent so much time with them after they were born, playing notes on the piano, and listening to classical music. I remember 
            because it seemed like it was all she ever did with them.&quot;</p>
        <p>Glimmer nodded. &quot;Mom spent a lot of time in the music room with you two.&quot;</p>
        <p>Ruby hummed the tune again. The shell lit up.</p>
        <p>&quot;Is that all?&quot; Emerald asked Cameron. &quot;So it lights up. What good is that?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;d make a nice night light,&quot; Francesca said. &quot;For you two, anyway.&quot;</p>
        <p>Glossy giggled. &quot;Just think! It&apos;s the middle of the night, and you want a glass of milk, but you don&apos;t want to 
            turn on lights and wake anyone! All you have to do is hum softly and the glow from the shell will give you enough light to 
            find your way down to the kitchen! Humming the whole way.&quot;</p>
        <p>Cameron said to Emerald, &quot;Remember? I said it&apos;s a box of some sort. The tests I ran show that there&apos;s two halves 
            that are fused together somehow. I think that that&apos;s the &quot;lock&quot; we need to open. I&apos;m not sure why the tune 
            only makes it light up.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;What are we going to do with it? I mean, don&apos;t we have to return it to the Library?&quot; Dazzle asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;We have a few days,&quot; Glissen told her.</p>
        <p>&quot;It should be put in the safe overnight,&quot; Amy said. &quot;We may not know its value, but we need to keep it safe.&quot;</p><br>
        
        <p>That night Emerald lay awake, her mind churning. The shell-box responded to the music box tune. Did their mother know that? It 
            couldn&apos;t be a coincidence. Wait. Some of that stuff was Gigi&apos;s also. Did Gigi know? Did her mother not know? What did 
            Amy say about Gigi and their heritage? That it was important in regard to the future... How long had the shell been in the archives? </p>
        <p>She tossed and turned. Why did the tune only make the shell light up? Why didn&apos;t it open? What else did it need?</p>
        <p>Finally, just as she was drifting off to sleep, something occurred to her, and she sat straight up, pulling the covers with her.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Hey!&quot; Ruby said grumpily. </p>
        <p>Em turned to her sister excitedly. &quot;I just had an idea! Wake up!&quot; She nudged Ruby gently.</p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;m awake, I&apos;m awake,&quot; Ruby said. &quot;Pretty difficult to sleep anyway, with all your moving around.&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald hopped out of the bed. &quot;Come on! Let&apos;s go get the shell!&quot;</p>
        <p>Ruby sat on the edge of the bed and looked at her sister.  &quot;Are you sure? It&apos;s the middle of the night.&quot; At 
            Em&apos;s expectant face, she nodded. &quot;Ok.&quot; </p>
        <p>Down the stairs they went, as quietly as they could. Once they were at the safe, Emerald halted. &quot;I forgot,&quot; she whispered. 
            &quot;We don&apos;t know the combination.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;ll get Amy,&quot; Glissen said, and the twins nearly jumped out of their skin.</p>
        <p>&quot;Glissen! How did you know? We were trying to be so quiet!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s just a sense I have. If something exciting is about to happen, my body goes on alert. And,&quot; she wagged 
            her finger at the twins, &quot;Shame on you for not including me in your midnight treasure hunt!&quot; </p>
        <p>With a little &quot;Hmph!&quot; Glissen turned and scampered away. It seemed only moments before she was back, with Amy.</p>
        <p>Amy yawned. &quot;Did you figure it out?&quot; she asked as she turned the dial on the safe.</p>
        <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. It&apos;s just an idea that I had,&quot; Emerald explained. &quot;I couldn&apos;t sleep.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Me either,&quot; said Glissen. </p>
        <p>Amy opened the door to the safe and took out the shell. </p>
        <p>&quot;You hold it, please,&quot; Emerald said to Amy. She turned to Ruby and said, &quot;In harmony.&quot;</p>
        <p>Ruby nodded. </p>
        <p>With their eyes on each other&apos;s face, Emerald and Ruby took a deep breath and pursed their lips to whistle.</p><br>

        <img src="/images/dazzles_secret/img_5385.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>

        <p>The little music box tune was really beautiful, whistled in harmony! As the shell began to glow, Ruby and Em turned to look 
            at it. And to everyone&apos;s surprise, the box snapped open!</p>
        <p>The whistling stopped as they all looked in amazement at each other.</p>
        <p>&quot;Woohoo!&quot; Glissen whooped. </p>
        <p>&quot;Sshhh!&quot; All three sisters shushed her.</p>
        <p>&quot;What&apos;s in it?&quot; Glissen whispered.</p>
        <p>&quot;Photos, paper... let&apos;s go to the living room,&quot; Amy said.</p>
        <p>With the shell on the coffee table, the girls took turns looking inside it.</p>
        <p>Ruby drew out a little velvet pouch. She loosened the drawstring and pulled out a necklace. </p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s beautiful,&quot; Emerald breathed. And indeed it was. From a delicate gold chain hung a peachy-pink gem in a 
            trillion-cut. </p>
        <p>&quot;Who do you think it belonged to?&quot; Ruby asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;Mom.&quot; Amy answered simply. </p>
        <p>&quot;She&apos;s right,&quot; Emerald said. She was looking at the photographs. &quot;Here&apos;s Mom and Gigi- they look so 
            young. Mom&apos;s wearing the necklace and—oh!&quot;  She gave a little gasp. &quot;Gigi is holding the shell!&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;Whaaat?&quot; Glissen peered at the picture. &quot;That&apos;s crazy. But not crazier than this.&quot; She held up a 
            thumb drive she had retrieved from the shell. &quot;Wonder what&apos;s on it? I&apos;m going to get my laptop, brb.&quot;</p>
        <p>Amy was opening the folded papers. &quot;A copy of a newspaper clipping from—wow, it&apos;s over 80 years old!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;What does it say?&quot; the twins asked in unison.</p>
        <p>Amy perused the short article.  &quot;It&apos;s about the success of Georgia Dazzle&apos;s bakery &quot;... still popular 
            after 5 years of business... due in part to her specialty of the winter season, Peppermint Sparkle Brownies. When pressed 
            about the &apos;secret&apos; ingredient, the only information Mrs. Dazzle gave is that the recipe belonged to Jillian Dazzle, 
            and has been handed down through the generations. &quot;It will remain in the Dazzle family,&quot; Mrs. Dazzle stated adamantly. 
            Before the cold months come to a close, try a warm peppermint brownie from the Bakery on 4th and Main, hours 7-3 daily...
            &quot;&quot; Amy trailed off.</p>
        <p>&quot;Huh,&quot; Emerald said. &quot;Did the recipe finally get lost along the way? This generation doesn&apos;t have it.&quot;</p>
        <p>Amy was unfolding the paper with the news clipping. &quot;Until now.&quot; She looked up at the twins. &quot;Check it out.&quot; 
            She laid the paper on the table in front of them.</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s in Gigi&apos;s handwriting—Peppermint Sparkle Brownies!&quot; </p>
        <p>Just then, the stairwell light came on, and Glissen came down the steps, followed by Lacey, Cameron, and Crystal. </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh no, did Glissen wake you?&quot; Ruby exclaimed. </p>
        <p>&quot;Sorta kinda maybe,&quot; Glissen popped her laptop on the table and turned it on. &quot;Everyone else is awake, too.&quot;</p>
        <p>Sure enough, more bare feet came down the stairs, and the living room was soon filled with the whole family.</p>
        <p>&quot;There&apos;s no way I was gonna wait till tomorrow so we could all see what&apos;s on this!&quot; Glissen said as she 
            inserted the thumb drive. </p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s a video file,&quot; she said, after a few moments.</p>
        <p>&quot;Can you stream it to the TV?&quot; Amy asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;Sure—&quot; Cameron turned the TV on, and they all waited breathlessly for Glissen to open the file.</p>
        <p>The TV screen showed some static, then suddenly Aurora&apos;s smiling face appeared. </p>
        <p>It was as if the entire room held its breath! </p>
        <p>The camera panned out from their mother&apos;s face to reveal that it was a picture of her next to the words Happy Graduation 
            Day!</p>
        <p>&quot;An invitation to her graduation party?&quot; Diamond said, to be shushed by her sisters.</p>
        <p>The screen changed to a video of Gigi. &quot;Happy day, my girl! Your Dad and I want you to know how proud we are of you, 
            graduating from the Arts Academy with two majors! Where your life takes you now is your choice, and we are certain it will 
            be successful, for you are a dedicated, determined, loving person; beautiful on the inside and out. </p>
        <p>But as a mom, I have to take this opportunity to compile some of my favorite bits of your life—I promise it&apos;s not too 
            embarrassing! Maybe this is more for me than you, but you know what I always say—never forget where you&apos;ve come from; 
            it will help you know where you&apos;re going. And...I love you.&quot;</p>
        <p>Gigi&apos;s face was replaced by an older video, of a toddler taking tentative steps to a very youthful Gigi.  Then came a 
            few more home video snippets, following Aurora as a young girl. Her lovely blonde hair grew longer with each year that passed. 
            The videos turned into a series of snapshots of Aurora as a teenager, laughing with friends, smiling prettily for the camera, 
            and one with her looking peevish at having her picture taken.</p>
        <p>The pictures turned to videos again, this time with a short clip of a dance performance when she was young, and then of her singing 
            in the backyard while on a swing. </p>
        <p>Then the screen went dark for a moment. When the light came up again, the picture was so clear, it was evident that the quality of 
            the recording was superior.</p>
        <p>&quot;Is that a – stage?&quot; Dazzle asked softly.</p>
        <p>It was indeed a stage. As the Dazzle sisters watched, a young Aurora twirled onto the stage and posed. As soft music filled the 
            air, she began to dance, gracefully moving to the music as if she were one with it.</p>
        <p>Amy and Ruby looked at Emerald. Her eyes were huge as she watched her mother dance. &quot;Breathe,&quot; Ruby whispered. Em smiled, 
            but didn&apos;t take her eyes off the screen.</p>
        <p>The dance was not more than two minutes long, and as it came to an end, an audience erupted in applause. </p>
        <p>&quot;Must have been a performance—maybe at the Arts Academy?&quot; Diamond mused.</p>
        <p>&quot;Ssh, here&apos;s another!&quot; Glossy said.</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s the Lascana!&quot; Glissen cried. </p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s Riette!&quot; said Amy.</p>
        <p>The film displayed Riette, introducing a young singer with &quot;an unforgettable voice&quot; and then Aurora&apos;s 
            beautiful voice filled the room.</p>
        <p>The Dazzle sisters sat, transfixed. As the song came to a close, Ruby&apos;s soft &quot;Wow!&quot; made everyone 
            nod in agreement.</p><br>

            <img src="/images/dazzles_secret/Livingroom with TV final.png" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>

        <p>The video then changed to another home video, taken right in the very room where they all sat. A cake decorated with a 
            graduation cap sat in the center and paper streamers hung about the windows and stairs. There was Aurora and Gigi, among 
            friends and family, amid laughter and talking. </p>
        <p>&quot;Hey, Aurora, sing a song will ya?&quot; Someone was heard saying.</p>
        <p>&quot;Sing! Sing!&quot; the others chanted.</p>
        <p>As they gently pushed Aurora in front of the camera, she grabbed Gigi&apos;s arm.</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh no-no! You can&apos;t get out of this one!&quot; Aurora cried, laughing as she pulled her mother with her.</p>
        <p>&quot;Just for you—your favorite lullaby to sing when I was little!&quot; </p>
        <p>Everyone in the video quieted as Aurora began to sing a sweet song about pennies. Gigi joined in, and, in harmony, the two 
            finished the song to shouts and applause from the ones around them. Aurora threw her arms around Gigi and the room was filled 
            with laughter and shouts of &quot;Bravo!&quot;  &quot;Congratulations!&quot; and other happy exclamations.</p>
        <p>The video faded, and the TV screen went black.</p>
        <p>&quot;The end,&quot; said Glissen.  </p>
        <p>&quot;That was amazing,&quot; Sapphire said quietly.</p>
        <p>&quot;Who knew that&apos;d be hiding in a box in the Library archives?&quot;  Crystal wondered.</p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;m glad you found it,&quot; Lacey said to Emerald.</p>
        <p>Francesca yawned and stretched. &quot;Totally worth getting up for.&quot; </p>
        <p>As the girls wandered upstairs in pairs, murmuring about the video, Amy, Emerald and Glissen still sat on the couch.</p>
        <p>&quot;Big day,&quot; Glissen said in the silence. Amy and Em both nodded.</p>
        <p>Amy rubbed Emerald&apos;s back. &quot;Think you can sleep now?&quot; she asked.</p>
        <p>Emerald nodded again. &quot;I am pretty tired.&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen yawned. &quot;Same.&quot; She removed the thumb drive, dropped it into the shell-box, and closed her laptop. </p>
        <p>After putting the shell back in the safe, Amy went to the stairs where Emerald and Glissen waited for her. She put her arms 
            around the two of them and squeezed.</p>
        <p>&quot;Lots to think about, huh?&quot; she said.</p>
        <p>Emerald nodded. &quot;For tomorrow though.&quot;</p>
        <p>As she tucked into bed, Emerald thought about the shell&apos;s contents. There were a lot of questions, but right now all 
            she could think of was her mother dancing. She smiled. She had a wish come true today!</p><br>
        
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>&quot;When are you going to make the brownies, Amy? I can&apos;t wait to have one.&quot; Emerald asked over breakfast the 
            next morning.</p>
        <p>&quot;After I make my own hand-written copies, per the instructions,&quot; Amy answered.</p>
        <p>The contents of the shell-box were arranged neatly on the table in front of them. A note on the back of the copy of the newspaper 
            article said: &quot;Preserve the history. Make a new copy. Memorize the recipe. Keep the secret!&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;What a funny thing to keep secret,&quot; Glissen giggled. </p>
        <p>&quot;I guess every family has something kooky in their history,&quot; mused Amy. &quot;And this is ours!&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;m curious about that necklace. Why was it locked up? For safekeeping? Do you think it&apos;s worth something?&quot; 
            Emerald asked.</p>
        <p>Glissen tapped her spoon thoughtfully on her cereal bowl. &quot;Do we know what the stone is, in the necklace?&quot; she asked.</p>
        <p>Amy put the milk in the fridge. &quot;If Diamond doesn&apos;t know then Cam can find out, in her lab.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I wonder why Mom put in there? Why not just wear it?&quot; Emerald asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;I wonder the same thing,&quot; Amy said. &quot;She used to wear it; I remember. I just can&apos;t remember when she stopped 
            wearing it.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Do you think she put it in the box with the thumb drive? I mean, that drive is not as old as the rest of the stuff in it.&quot; 
            Glissen put the spoon down and lifted the bowl to her lips, slurping up the rest of the milk noisily.</p>
        <p>&quot;What I really want to know about is that picture of Gigi holding the shell.  That is from a long time ago, and yet the box seems 
            to be quite &quot;technologically advanced&quot; as Cam would say.&quot; Emerald took her dishes to the sink. She stared out the window 
            for a moment. Then she turned back to her sisters. &quot;Do you think we&apos;ll ever find the answers?&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen brought her bowl over. As she ran the water to wash it she said, &quot;Hey, look at how many things we discovered over just the 
            last couple days! Darling, we are young, with SO much time ahead of us!&quot; She batted her eyes at Emerald. </p>
        <p>Em laughed and tossed a dish towel at her. &quot;True!&quot;</p>
        <p>Amy was standing at the table, looking at the necklace. &quot;Glissen&apos;s right. We should be proud of ourselves, about everything 
            we&apos;ve learned.&quot; She continued thoughtfully,  &quot;I think all of this means that there&apos;s a lot more to Mom and our 
            family than we thought. We should be on the lookout for any unusual things that could possibly mean something.&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald and Glissen both nodded. Then Em picked up the thumb drive and held it up with a grin.</p>
        <p>&quot;But right now, I&apos;m gonna go watch Mom dance! Who&apos;s with me?&quot; </p>
        <p>And she skipped out of the kitchen with her two sisters following her.</p><br>
