        <h1>The Dazzle City business scene in motion!</h1>
    </div>
        <p>There are a lot of Dazzle Girls who are busily running their businesses every single day of the week.
        Let’s see how some of them have recently blossomed:</p>

        <h3>Grace’s Cakes!</h3>
        <p>‘Grace’s Cakes’ is a bakery run by Grace Glamour, one of the Dazzle’s cousins. This business is fresh off the 
            street! ‘Grace’s Cakes’ features many tasty treats in the form of cupcakes, tarts and tortes, as well as 
            made-to-order specialty cakes! So, if you’re looking for a dazzling bakery, this is the one!  Keep an eye out 
            for our upcoming exclusive coverage of the <a href="graces_cakes.html">grand opening</a>!</p>

        <h3>Amy’s Pasta!</h3>
        <p>‘Amy’s Pasta’ is a restaurant run by Amy Dazzle. This restaurant features Spaghetti and Meatballs
        (the classic), Shrimp Scampi, Pasta Carbonara, Noodle soup, and the restaurant’s special, the ‘Mac
        ‘n’ Amy’! So far, ‘Amy’s Pasta’ has been going strong. So there is no need to worry about the
        business until another time, when a new recipe is featured… and that may be soon!</p>

        <h3>Glossy Finishes!</h3>
        <p>‘Glossy Finishes’ is Glossy Dazzle’s arts and crafts shop. Just a while ago, the shop got a wonderful
        addition- puppies! Glossy loves puppies, and when 8 of them were too much even for the Dazzle
        Mansion, she decided to bring some of them to work! Since then not a lot has happened, but
        Glossy continues to improve her business in many ways—she recently started weekly art classes
        with happy results!</p>

        <h3>Crystal’s Fashions!</h3>
        <p>‘Crystal’s Fashions’ is the storefront for clothing designed by Crystal Dazzle. Crystal is busily
        preparing for the reveal of her Spring Collection, in addition to her new line of spring gowns. Crystal
        has a head full of ideas for frocks! So, if you ever need some new, fashionable clothes, then you
        should come to ‘Crystal’s Fashions’, because here, clothes fascinate!</p>

        <h3>Diamond’s Designs!</h3>
        <p>Diamond Dazzle’s jewelry shop is located in a great part of town—the popular river district. Local
        residents and tourists alike are drawn to the area’s restaurants and specialty shops. “Diamond’s
        Designs” gets not only people who come specifically for her creations, but also many a couple
        popping in after a romantic meal!</p>
