        <h1>Primrose Meets Lacey</h1>

        <div>

          <p>Once Upon a time, Primrose lived with her sister, Spangle and Spangle's friends, the Dazzles. Primrose didn't know 
            the Dazzles very well --after all, she had spent the past eight years in England, only returning a few months ago!  
            So, she usually stayed close to Spangle. Until this one time where Primrose was all alone.... without Spangle.
          </p>
          
          <p>It was a Tuesday, and the weather was pleasantly warm. Primrose was in Dazzle City's Central Park admiring the 
            flowers-- more specifically, the primroses.
          </p>
          
          <p>Primrose thought: "With my sister away in Dazzle Town, working on her latest project with Francesca and Glossy 
            Dazzle, I get to relax and look at all the flowers I want!"
          </p>
          
          <p>Primrose paused.</p>
          
          <p>"Official downside. No more Spangle. Official upside-- less Dazzles to run into, heehee."</p>
          
          <p>Primrose looked carefully at the flowers. A couple strolled by.  Three kids and a mother walked past. As she 
            continued looking at the flowers she decided that they looked prettier than on Sunday.
          </p>
          
          <p>"I think you look lovely, little flowers!"" she told them.</p>
          
          <p>Her phone buzzed. Primrose looked at it; it was an app update. As she started to put it away, she had an idea.</p>
          
          <p>"I know! I'll text Spangle a little hello!"</p>
          
          <p><b><i>P: Hiya!<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
          
          <p><b><i>S: Hey.<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
          
          <p><b><i>P: Busy?<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
          
          <p><b><i>S: Yep<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
          
          <p><b><i>P: K bye<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
          
          <p><b><i>S: bye<o:p></o:p></i></b></p>
          
          <p>"Well, I guess I'll find out all about it when she gets home."</p>
          
          <p>As she put her phone away, she heard a voice from the other side of the hedge.</p>
          
          <p>"Oh, you sweet little thing. All happy in the sunlight, aren't you? And don't you smell wonderful."</p>
          
          <p>Someone talking to the flowers, like she did! Primrose peeked around the bush and saw a girl about her age. 
            She had a white frilly dress on, but wore a western vest as well. She knew that girl!  It was Lacey Dazzle. 
            But did she want to talk to a Dazzle right now? </p>
          
          <p>"And look at you, beautiful! I do believe you are looking more radiant than the last time I saw you."</p>
          
          <p>Primrose couldn't help but chuckle. Lacey gasped, and looked over her shoulder at Primrose. </p>
          
          <p>"Oh! I didn't see you there. You caught me talking to the flowers."</p>
          
          <p>Primrose leaned over and took a big sniff of the flower Lacey had talked to.</p>
          
          <p>"Just like me." Primrose told her.</p>
          
          <p>Lacey looked shy.</p>
          
          <p>"Really?"</p>
          
          <p>Primrose nodded. Then she looked back to the flowers and reached out to touch one gently.</p>
          
          <p>"Your petals look lovely today, Ella!"</p>
          
          <p>Lacey's eyebrows went up.</p>
          
          <p>"You name the flowers too?"</p>
          
          <p>Primrose nodded again.</p>
          
          <p>"There's a bellflower over there that I named Glissen because it looked so happy, bouncing in the breeze."</p>
          
          <p>Lacey giggled.</p>
          
          <p>"I'd like to call that Peony Francesca, it looks so elegant."</p>
          
          <p>Primrose smiled.</p>
          
          <p>"I was going to look at the Oriental poppies, would you like to come?"</p>
          
          <p>"Of course."</p>
          
          <p>As they walked, Primrose asked , "Which flowers do you fancy?"</p>
          
          <p>Lacey looked puzzled. "Fancy?"" she repeated.</p>
          
          <p>"Oh, sorry." Primrose tried again, "Do you have a favorite flower?"</p>
          
          <p>"Oh. Blush pink roses. You?"</p>
          
          <p>"Primroses, of course!"" Primrose laughed.</p>
          
          <p>"And for fragrance? What flower do you &#8212;" Lacey paused, "er, <i>fancy</i>?"</p>
          
          <p>"Freesia. You?"</p>
          
          <p>"Lily of the Valley, always and forever."" Lacey was quite certain.</p>
          
          <p>"They do smell rather glorious."" Primrose agreed. </p>
          
          <p>"Ooo, the irises are in bloom, look at that color!"" </p>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <p><i>LATER....</i></p>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <p>The girls got ice cream together and sat on a white bench by a hedge of brightly colored flowers to eat it.</p>
          
          <p>"It's my dream to visit the botanical gardens in Shanghai."  Primrose licked her strawberry cone.</p>
          
          <p>"Me too! And go to the Holland Tulip festival."" Lacey sighed.  "Wouldn't it be lovely to travel the world just 
            to see the flowers in every country?"</p>
          
          <p>"Yes, it would! Although you are the first person I've found that thinks so Lacey!"</p>
          
          <p>"Yeah, Glissen would be so bored, right?"</p>
          
          <p>"She is rather...lively."</p>
          
          <p>Lacey snorted into her ice cream. "Definitely. Sometimes she can be too much for me."
          
          <p>Primrose looked at her.</p>
          
          <p>"I forgot. Living with all of your sisters must be quite a different experience for you."</p>
          
          <p>"Yeah. Before, it was... A lot quieter. Most of the time."</p>
          
          <p>"Are you..." Primrose paused. "Um, afraid your  &#8212; I don't know what to call her..."</p>
          
          <p>"Step-mom," Lacey helped Primrose out. Talking about her past was so awkward! "I used to call her Mom... I mean, 
            she <i>was</i> the one who raised me. Sort of."</p>
          
          <p>"Are you afraid she'll find you?"" Primrose asked.</p>
          
          <p>"Nah. She wasn't ever <i>mean</i> to me...and she was hardly ever there."  After a moment, Lacey crunched up the 
            rest of her sugar cone, and said, "It's nice to have family around, to feel a part of something.  And even though 
            it's a little unusual to have someone always looking out for me, I'm getting used to it. I like it. Hey, that reminds 
            me; I wanted to bring dessert home for everyone. What do you think? Another round of ice cream for later?"</p>
          
          <p>"Ice cream twice in one day?" Primrose grinned.  "Brilliant!  Or, best day ever!"</p>
          
          <p>"I like brilliant!" Lacey smiled. "I might start saying
          that."</p>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <p>On their way home, Primrose's phone rang. "Hey, it's Spangle. She must have time to talk. Hey sis," she said into the 
            phone. </p>
          
          <p>"Hey, how's it going? Sorry about before; I was in the middle of a "this isn't the door we ordered" crisis. Are you 
            okay?" Spangle sounded concerned.</p>
          
          <p>"Yes, I'm fine. Didn't mean to worry you! Is the door problem all sorted now?"</p>
          
          <p>"Yeah, it was just a mix-up. I'll tell you all about it when I get home &#8212; which will be a day or so later than 
            I expected. I was gonna call sooner to tell you, but..."</p>
          
          <p>"The door happened."" Primrose said.</p>
          
          <p>"Yup. Anyway, I'm really sorry. Are you going to be alright?" Spangle asked anxiously.</p>
          
          <p>Primrose looked over at Lacey, who was looking happily at the flavors of ice cream she carried.</p>
          
          <p>"Yes, Spangle. I am good. Actually, I'm great." She smiled.  "I'll tell you all about it when you come home. 
            No worries."</p>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <p><i>LATER...</i></p>
          
          <p></p>
          
          <p>Lacey and Primrose got home later that evening. So did Francesca!</p>
          
          <p>"Hi, girls!" Francesca smiled.</p>
          
          <p>"Hi," Lacey and Primrose waved.</p>
          
          <p>Spangle and Glossy are going to finish the building later this week, then I'll work on the inside for a few 
            days," Francesca informed them.</p>
          
          <p>"YAY!" Primrose cried, "That's the quickest Spangle's ever done when building!"</p>
          
          <p>"Good for you!" Lacey smiled.</p>
          
          <p>"Say, Lacey?" said Primrose, "Let's promise to be B.F.F.F.S!"</p>
          
          <p>"Best flower friends forever!" Lacey smiled.</p>
          
          <p>And the girls pinky promised to be best friends for forever and ever and ever.</p>
          
          <p><b>THE END!</b></p><br><br>
