        <p>As it was extremely late by the time the girls got home, they decided to save the search for the other music box for 
            the next day.</p>
        <p>Amy yawned. &quot;I think it&apos;s in the basement...&quot;</p>  
        <p>&quot;Then that&apos;s where we&apos;ll start! See you tomorrow!&quot; Glissen blew her sisters a kiss. &quot;Sparkle 
            sisters out!&quot;</p><br>
                            
        <ph3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>After breakfast the next morning, when the girls arrived in the basement, they started looking for the music box.</p> 
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s different from the one Riette gave us. This one opens, and it has a little velvet space inside that 
            holds little mementos,&quot; Amy explained. She sighed. &quot;I wish I could remember what Mom kept in there. All I 
            can think of is a penny. But that doesn&apos;t make sense.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Maybe the first penny she earned?&quot; Glissen offered. &quot;That used to be important to folks in the old 
            days.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;Sheesh, you sound like Mom is so ancient! Just because we haven&apos;t seen her in a long time doesn&apos;t 
            mean we&apos;re talking about hundreds of years ago!&quot; exclaimed Emerald. </p>
        <p>&quot;Can we just start looking?&quot; Amy asked. &quot;I&apos;ll take this corner.&quot; She went to the far end 
            of the basement, around the corner. She wasn&apos;t sure why, but she was feeling a little anxious.</p>
        <p>&quot;Fine,&quot; grumbled Glissen. She went to the opposite end of the basement, where there were boxes and picture 
            frames. &quot;I&apos;ll look here.&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald settled down in the middle of the basement, with all sorts of odds and ends. </p>
        <p>They searched and searched.</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, I think it&apos;s hopeless!&quot; Glissen exclaimed after a couple of hours had not revealed anything 
            even close to a music box. &quot;The music box is NOWHERE!&quot; She brushed a cobweb out of her hair.</p>
        <p>The girls had worked their way to the far back of the center of the basement. Emerald looked at Amy in despair. </p>
        <p>&quot;Don&apos;t say that. I know Mom&apos;s stuff was down here. Maybe Glimmer moved it? We just have to—aaaaahhh!&quot; 
            Amy cried. </p>
        <p>Glissen and Emerald looked around for Amy. What had happened just then was so sudden—it was as if Amy had dropped 
            out of sight!</p>
        <p>&quot;Um, girls? Down here!&quot; peeped a familiar voice. </p>
        <p>Emerald and Glissen looked down to see... AMY! </p>
        <p>&quot;Apparently there is a secret floor beneath the basement!&quot; said Glissen, &quot;I&apos;m so curious...&quot;</p> 
        <p>&quot;Girls! Mom&apos;s stuff is down here!&quot; Amy cried as Emerald and Glissen climbed down to where she was.</p><br> 
        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2743.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>&quot;Wow...!&quot; said Emerald.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Amazing!!&quot; Glissen squealed. </p>
        <p>&quot;Maybe the music box is here,&quot; Amy said. </p>
        <p>And the girls began to open the trunks and boxes, looking for the music box.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Isn&apos;t this a lot of stuff for one person—who hasn&apos;t even been gone that long?&quot; Glissen questioned.</p>
        <p>&quot;Gigi&apos;s stuff is here too,&quot; Amy said, referring to their grandmother. &quot;Looks like Mom kept all of 
            her mom&apos;s mementos and stuff, too.&quot; She held up a box. &quot;This one is marked &quot;Gigi&quot; in mom&apos;s 
            handwriting.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I love having a gramma named Gigi,&quot; Glissen smiled. &quot;It&apos;s sooo... dazzling.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I don&apos;t remember Gigi much, except she used to make Peppermint Sparkle Brownies,&quot; Emerald recalled. 
            &quot;It was my favorite dessert.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;What I wouldn&apos;t give for that recipe!&quot; Amy said. &quot;They were delicious.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Hey look!&quot; Glissen held up a small picture frame. &quot;A picture of Gigi and Mom.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Anyone wonder why all of their stuff is down here? I mean, who put it here? Who even knew about this &apos;secret&apos; 
            basement?&quot; Emerald wondered as she peered into a trunk.</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s a good question,&quot; Amy replied, a little distractedly. She was flipping through some photos.</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, no music box,&quot; said Glissen, a little while later. </p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;m sorry, girls. I don&apos;t know where else to look,&quot; Amy told Emerald and Glissen with a sigh. 
            &quot;But we really should ask Glimmer if she knows anything.&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald had a wooden box that held old letters, post cards, and other correspondence. About to close it, she 
            noticed a pamphlet taped to the lid. Carefully unsticking it, she saw that it was for the local museum. As she 
            opened it, a photograph slipped out, onto the floor.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hey, guys,&quot; she said. She picked up the photo and held the two things out to the others. </p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s a pamphlet for the Dazzle City Museum & Library,&quot; said Amy. </p>
        <p>&quot;And a picture of something!&quot; Glissen chirped. 
        <p>The picture seemed old, and it looked like it was taken in a dark room. It appeared to be a large bookcase, 
            with cubbies containing odd things like lamps, jars, books, hats, and other paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s certainly a picture of something,&quot; Amy said.</p>
        <p>&quot;Could it be in the Museum?&quot; Emerald asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; said Amy. &quot;Curious that it was attached to the lid though. Does the box 
            have a marking of who&apos;s it is?&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald turned the box around. The box had the word Heritage on the outside.</p>
        <p>&quot;Heritage? As in our heritage?&quot; Glissen wondered.</p>
        <p>&quot;Gigi was all about our heritage,&quot; Amy said. &quot;I remember her telling us bedtime stories and 
            they always had Dazzle names in them. She used to say, &quot;The future is reliant on the past&quot; or some 
            such thing.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Look here,&quot; Glissen said. She held up the pamphlet. &quot;Someone&apos;s written something.&quot;</p>
        <p>Sure enough, on the inside someone had written in lovely cursive.</p>
        <p>Amy took the pamphlet and read the words aloud: &quot;For safety&apos;s sake.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Glissen said. &quot;What&apos;s that supposed to mean?&quot;</p>
        <p>Amy looked at the pamphlet. &quot;I don&apos;t know,&quot; she said slowly.</p><br>
        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_3876.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>Emerald held up the photograph. &quot;Do you think there&apos;s something in this that belongs to us? I mean, 
            why is it here unless it&apos;s important?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Only one way to find out!&quot; Glissen cried. She checked her watch. &quot;And it&apos;s only one 
            o&apos;clock—time to clean up and head out. Hey, we tend to be doing that a lot lately!&quot; </p><br>
                                            
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>When Amy pulled into the parking lot for the museum, it was nearly 3 PM. </p>
        <p>&quot;Huh,&quot; said Glissen. &quot;This is waaay bigger than I thought.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;We don&apos;t have much time before they close,&quot; Amy said. &quot;Let&apos;s get in there.&quot;</p>
        <p>The front of the museum was a huge façade of white stone and glass. The entryway was spacious, with a high 
            ceiling that reflected voices from people talking about their visit. </p>
        <p>&quot;Looks like we get passes over there,&quot; Amy pointed to a long desk off to the right, ahead of them.</p> 
        <p>Emerald flipped the pamphlet from their mother&apos;s box over. &quot;If they renovated the Museum, will this room in 
            the picture even be here anymore?&quot; she worried.</p>
        <p>&quot;That&apos;s a good question, Em,&quot; Glissen patted her arm. &quot;Don&apos;t worry, we&apos;ll find out.&quot; </p>
        <p>The girls each got a pass and a map of the museum. </p>
        <p>&quot;This place is huge—do you think we should split up?&quot; Glissen asked.</p>
        <p>Emerald looked at Amy anxiously.</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, let&apos;s stay together,&quot; Amy said comfortably. &quot;I think we&apos;ll have more fun.&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen shrugged. &quot;Ok. But let&apos;s start with the Arts and Antiquities gallery!&quot; </p><br>
        
        <p>As they walked into the Arts and Antiquities gallery, the three girls gasped. It was a giant circular room, 
            with a little balcony in the far back to look down at eighteenth century antiquities. </p>
        <p>&quot;I. Am. So. AMAZED!&quot; Glissen cried, rushing over to the balcony. </p>
        <p>&quot;Well, looks like she knows where she is going,&quot; Amy joked. </p>
        <p>&quot;Um, Amy,&quot; Emerald said timidly, &quot;Could we go over there? To the left? Where the nineteenth 
            century sculptures are?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Alright,&quot; said Amy. 
        <p>The two girls walked over to the sculptures. Emerald noticed a marble sculpture of a ballerina in arabesque.</p> 
        <p>Emerald stared at the sculpture, completely enthralled. Amy, who was standing a little ways away, gazed about 
            the room, wondering about the picture they were trying to match. She looked over her shoulder to see Emerald, 
            looking mesmerized. </p>
        <p>&quot;Hey, Em. Whatcha looking at?&quot; Amy asked as she paced over. </p>
        <p>Emerald did not seem to notice Amy. </p><br>
        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2683.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>&quot;Ooh la la!&quot; said Amy. </p>
        <p>&quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; said Emerald. </p>
        <p>Amy looked from the sculpture to Emerald.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Fascinating,&quot; Amy commented. </p>
        <p>Emerald nodded distractedly. She seemed to be lost in thought. </p>
        <p>&quot;Are you alright?&quot; Amy asked worriedly. </p>
        <p>Emerald blinked. &quot;Oh! I&apos;m okay, thank you,&quot; she gave Amy a tiny smile. </p>
        <p>&quot;Do you miss Mom?&quot; asked Amy softly.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Emerald. </p>
        <p>&quot;Me too,&quot; Amy said. She slipped her arm around Emerald and hugged her.</p> 
        <p>Emerald put her head on Amy&apos;s shoulder. &quot;I just wish I knew her better,&quot; she said in a small voice.</p>
        <p>Amy held her tight. &quot;I have an idea. Glimmer and I should tell you some stories of our favorite Mom moments.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I&apos;d like that,&quot; Emerald sighed. &quot;But when would she have time?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Glimmer is still our sister, even though she has a life of her own going on. She&apos;ll make time for you,&quot; 
            Amy said confidently. &quot;What&apos;s important to you, is important to the rest of us. All our other sisters still 
            live with us and love us. I say we&apos;re pretty lucky, you know?&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;Yeah,&quot; Emerald agreed. </p>
        <p>&quot;Are you going to be okay?&quot; said Amy. </p>
        <p>Emerald nodded and said: &quot;I&apos;m good. Thank you.&quot;</p>
        <p>Amy smiled, and the two sisters continued looking at sculptures. </p><br>
        
        <p>Glissen was quite busy, staring at all of the antiquities. She, herself, even wondered if she was EVER going to stop.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Hmm, hmm, hmmmm,&quot; Glissen hummed.</p>
        <p>She stared, and stared, and STARED. </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh, gee,&quot; Glissen mumbled, &quot;I&apos;ve probably been staring for at least HOURS!&quot;</p> 
        <p>She took a look at her watch. </p>
        <p>&quot;I have been staring for... 15 MINUTES!?&quot; Glissen exclaimed, &quot;How??&quot; </p>
        <p>Glissen peered over at Emerald and Amy, who were busily looking at a collection of 19th century sculptures. </p>
        <p>&quot;Weird. They seem soooo happy. But, still, aren&apos;t I just dandy right about now? I suppose not, 
            if I have not moved for at least 15 and a half minutes,&quot; Glissen explained to herself. </p>
        <p>&quot;If I have not moved for 15 minutes straight, then my legs could be jelly right now. If they are not, 
            then I should be able to walk a couple feet, yes?&quot; muttered Glissen frantically. </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh! But who CARES about their feet, anyway? Exactly WHO? You see, THAT is the question!&quot; Glissen 
            told herself, &quot;And if that ISN&apos;T the question, then what is?!&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;I should probably stop talking right about now. I suppose I am distracting the others, yes? Yet if 
            I&apos;m not, then could this talking still be COMPLETELY worthless? Aaaaand, if it is, then I should just 
            ZIP IT! Yes? Is that correct, or not? Oh! I need to be talked to!&quot; Glissen exclaimed. </p>
        <p>&quot;But, yet again, it&apos;s nice to be alone, and I think I have built some character just standing right 
            here for... 16 AND A HALF MINUTES?!&quot; Glissen exclaimed. </p>
        <p>&quot;Oooh! Now THAT draws the line! Well, being alone, that is,&quot; said Glissen, &quot;Grr! I NEED to stop!&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;Miss?&quot; a voice said from behind her. &quot;Are you ok? Can I help you find your way to the entrance?&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen whirled around to see a museum employee standing near her. </p>
        <p>&quot;Oh! No, thanks! My sisters are right over ... &quot; she looked around wildly. There! She spotted Amy&apos;s 
            long blonde hair. &quot;Right over there!&quot; she said, triumphantly pointing to Amy and Emerald across the room. 
            &quot;No need to worry about me!&quot;</p>
        <p>The employee gently cleared his throat. &quot;But it is closing time, miss.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;What?! Closing—&quot; Glissen looked at her watch, again. &quot;But it&apos;s... seriously? NO more time has 
            passed?  What..&quot; she shook her wrist, then slapped her forehead. &quot;Ugh! My watch stopped! </p>
        <p>&quot;But wait—we didn&apos;t find—oh no!&quot; she cried.</p>
        <p>The employee looked concerned. &quot;Did you lose something?&quot; he asked.</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, no, but,&quot; Glissen suddenly had an idea. &quot;Maybe you can help!&quot; she exclaimed. She peered 
            at his name tag. &quot;Stefan.&quot; She smiled up at him.</p>
        <p>&quot;I can try,&quot; he  smiled.</p>
        <p>&quot;Glissen,&quot; she said, sticking out her hand in greeting. </p>
        <p>&quot;I know,&quot; Stefan said, shaking her hand. &quot;I&apos;ve seen your show.&quot; </p>
        <p>&quot;OH! Well, uh...&quot; Glissen paused, then: &quot;Come with me!&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen took off at a trot towards her sisters. &quot;Em!&quot; she called (sort of) softly, as they got closer. 
            Both Emerald and Amy turned toward her, looking with surprise at Glissen and the employee rushing towards them.</p> 
        <p>Glissen slowed up at and stopped at Emerald&apos;s side. &quot;Can I see Mom&apos;s photo, please?&quot; she huffed, 
            a little short of breath. This room was HUGE!</p>
        <p>Emerald handed her the picture and Glissen turned back to Stefan. </p>
        <p>&quot;We are wondering if there&apos;s a room like this, here in the Museum. Do you know it?&quot; she asked, 
            sharing the photograph with him.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hmm, doesn&apos;t ring a bell,&quot; Stefan said, shaking his head.</p>
        <p>&quot;Are you sure? Oh, I just can&apos;t stand it!&quot; Glissen cried, extremely disappointed.</p>
        <p>Stefan handed the photo to Emerald. &quot;Well, I&apos;ve only worked here for a few months, and I have to say that 
            even I&apos;m not sure I&apos;ve been in every room; the Museum is quite big. But, I think I know someone who may 
            be able to answer your question.&quot;</p>
        <p>All three girls perked up.</p>
        <p>&quot;Follow me,&quot; Stefan said. </p>
        <p>The girls followed Stefan as he led them through the museum, towards the entrance. He stopped at the information 
            desk and checked some papers. Then he turned to the girls and said, &quot;If you can wait just a minute, Mr. 
            Rosing will be here to close up soon.&quot;</p>
        <p>They didn&apos;t have long to wait. An older man in a security suit soon came through an employee door behind 
            the desk. </p>
        <p>&quot;Why, Stefan! You working today? Giving tours to the pretty ladies?&quot; His white teeth flashed in his 
            dark face, as he chuckled softly. </p>
        <p>&quot;Mr. Rosing,&quot; Stefan started, to be interrupted by Mr. Rosing.</p>
        <p>&quot;Samuel! How many times do I have to tell you?! It&apos;s Samuel to you, Stefan. All those &apos;Misters&apos; 
            makes me feel old,&quot; Samuel smiled again.</p>
        <p>&quot;Sorry, sir, uh, Samuel,&quot; said Stefan.</p>
        <p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; peeped Glissen, &quot;But could you take a look at this photo for a quick second?&quot;</p>
        <p>Samuel peered at the photo. &quot;Ah! The basement in the museum,&quot; he said, nodding. &quot;I know it well. 
            Haven&apos;t been in there for years.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Is it—&quot; Glissen gulped, &quot;gone? In the renovations?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Renova—oh,  you girls are in the wrong place!&quot; Samuel said. &quot;This here is the Museum for Greater 
            Dazzle City. The one you&apos;re looking for is the old Museum and Library in the older part of the city; down 
            by the Mill district. More of a library than museum, now. But it&apos;s still there.&quot; He smiled. &quot;The 
            basement too.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Well, if that&apos;s the case, then we better head over!&quot; exclaimed Glissen.</p>
        <p>Emerald tentatively extended her hand to Samuel. &quot;Thank you so much for your help,&quot; she said.</p>
        <p>Samuel took her hand. &quot;You are very welcome,&quot; he replied warmly. </p>
        <p>&quot;Byeeee Stefan! Byeeee Samuel!&quot; Glissen waved goodbye as she, Emerald, and Amy headed out the door.</p><br>
        
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        
        <p>When the girls got home, Amy opened up a map of Dazzle City on the table and Glissen and Emerald gathered around it.</p>
        <p>&quot;Here&apos;s where we were today,&quot; Amy pointed. &quot;And the old mill district is by the river, on that side of 
            town.&quot; </p>
        <p>They looked closer at the mill district.</p>
        <p>&quot;Found it!&quot; Glissen tapped the map. </p><br>
        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2733.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>&quot;Great!&quot; As Amy folded the map up, she said, &quot;We can leave after breakfast. Right now, I just need supper 
            and some sleep. It&apos;s been a long day.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Long day, I&apos;ll say!&quot; Glissen murmured after she&apos;d brushed her teeth that night. &quot;I think I 
            walked a thousand miles in that museum.&quot; She trotted down to see if Emerald was still up. Em was in her pjs, sitting 
            on the pink chaise. </p>
        <p>&quot;Yo,&quot; Glissen said. &quot;Whatcha thinkin&apos; &apos;bout?&quot;</p>
        <p>Emerald looked up at Glissen. &quot;Just...well, look at this.&quot; She pushed the photograph over. </p>
        <p>&quot;Seen it.&quot; Glissen wanted to be in that room, not look at a picture of it anymore.</p>
        <p>&quot;There&apos;s writing on it that we didn&apos;t see before. Look, on the back. It&apos;s pretty faint.&quot;</p>
        <p>NOW she had Glissen&apos;s attention. </p>
        <p>&quot;I can&apos;t read it, are you sure?&quot; Glissen squinted at it. She looked at Em and then noticed a magnifying 
            glass in her other hand. Emerald handed it to her.</p>
        <p>&quot;It&apos;s value is beyond what the eye can see,&quot; Glissen read out loud. &quot;Woah. What does that mean?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;I don&apos;t know. But it seems like it&apos;s definitely referring to something specific.&quot; Emerald yawned. 
            &quot;Amy&apos;s gone to bed already. We&apos;ll show her in the morning.&quot;</p>
        <p>Glissen let out a gusty sigh. &quot;Can I get a piggyback ride to my room? I feel like I ran a marathon today! Just...can&apos;t... 
            go...another...step...&quot; and she slumped dramatically over the chaise. </p>
        <p>Emerald laughed. &quot;I&apos;m just as tired as you,&quot; and she tickled Glissen. Glissen gave a little shriek and bounced up.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Okay, okay!&quot; She blew Emerald a kiss. &quot;Sleep tight! Love you!&quot; she called as she skipped out of the room.</p><br>
        
        <h3>~</h3><br>
        
        <p>The next morning, the girls checked their map.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Well, this is the place,&quot; said Amy, looking up from the map. In front of them was a big brick building.</p> 
        <p>&quot;Cool,&quot; Glissen said. </p>
        <p>&quot;I love old buildings,&quot; Emerald commented.</p><br>
        <img src="images/dazzles_secret/img_2761.JPG" alt="Riette"><p></p><br>
        <p>As they entered the building, they could feel the hush and silence of a quiet library. </p>
        <p>&quot;But what about the museum part?&quot; Glissen wondered.</p>
        <p>&quot;Ssshhh!!&quot; both Amy and Emerald said at once.</p>
        <p>&quot;Sorry! But what about the museum part?&quot; Glissen whispered.</p>
        <p>Amy tipped her head toward the front desk and raised her eyebrows. Glissen and Emerald nodded and followed Amy up 
            to the desk.</p>
        <p>&quot;Hello there,&quot; said the lady at the desk, &quot;How may I help you? Library pass?&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Hello,&quot; Amy said politely. &quot;We are actually looking for a particular room.&quot; Emerald handed 
            the photo to the lady. &quot;Is it possible to take a look around the room in this picture?&quot;</p>
        <p>The lady looked closely at the darkened photograph. &quot;This is the building&apos;s archives. In the basement.&quot; 
            She looked at the girls. &quot;What on earth would you want to see in there?&quot; she asked. Without waiting for an 
            answer, she handed the photo back and said briskly, &quot;The archives are off-limits to the public. I&apos;m 
            sorry.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Amy asked politely. &quot;There&apos;s something—&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;No exceptions,&quot; the lady interrupted Amy. &quot;Now if that is all?&quot;</p>
        <p>The girls turned away from the desk and slowly walked back to the car.</p>
        <p>Amy looked perplexed.</p>
        <p>Emerald looked heartbroken. </p>
        <p>Glissen looked stunned.</p>
        <p>What were they going to do?</p><br><br>
